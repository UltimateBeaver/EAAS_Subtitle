1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's go on to team. What are the questions here? First of all,

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:10,005
earlier in my youth in getting into software many years ago. It 

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,010
was kind of this superhero programmer. We are now in the post- 

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,014
superhero programmer. It was just the state of software, 

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,018
whatever it was 30 years ago was such that one smart person 

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,022
could build this brilliant thing better than anything that was 

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,024
out there. Why isn't that happening today? Why don't we have the 

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,028
single superhero anymore that we had 30 years ago? I think it's 

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,031
just that software is a lot better. It's raised the level of 

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,034
functionality and quality that you really can't do it by 

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,036
yourself. Now, to have a successful software engineering career, 

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
you have to be good at programming which a lot of you already 

13
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,043
are. You have to get along with others and you have to help make 

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:52,046
the team win. Quoting [ Fred Brooks 00:00:48] for the third time 

15
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,052
today, " There are no winners on a losing team, and no losers on 

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:58,054
a winning team." He said this about basketball at the University 

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,058
of North Carolina where he was, but no winners on a losing team. 

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,061
If the team loses you're not going to be bragging about that. If 

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,064
you're on that infamy hall of fame, hey, I was the best 

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,066
programmer on the FBI file case abandonment project, that's not 

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,070
a good thing as a resume. No losers on the winning team, hey, I 

22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:19,074
help found Google. I only did this minor role, but I help found 

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,079
Google. Man, if you help found Google, you're going to need that 

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,081
on your resume. It'd be pretty good. It turns out I've got a lot 

25
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:29,084
of experience in sports, in teams. I think one of my strengths 

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,089
is building teams. Ironically, I wasn't on a sport like football 

27
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,093
or any of the sports that involve a lot of teams. I did 

28
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:41,095
wrestling which is highly individual. This was high school. This 

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:47,101
is me. This is me and this is me, and this is 50 years later a 

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,107
coach and this is Rich Burn whose standing there and we were 

31
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
best men at each other's wedding and we're still good friends 

32
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
today. One of the things that these ... I had really good 

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,117
wrestling coaches. To talk the importance of working as a team 

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,119
even in an individual sport like wrestling and that's kind 

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,122
of ... That carries over today and I think that's one of my 

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,124
strengths as a faculty member. I can get all these independent 

37
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,126
faculty members to work together as a team, but basically 

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,129
you ... If you're in a winning team, there's no losers and 

39
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,132
that's what you need to be able to figure out what to do. All 

40
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,135
right, so what's an alternative? The Plan and Document has this 

41
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:23,138
program manager style and it's in hierarchical, depends on the 

42
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,143
manager, how should we organize an Agile team? It's probably not 

43
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,147
going to have this manager model. Is there some alternative to 

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,150
this hierarchical model? That's what's called Scrum. Scrum is an 

45
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:39,154
example of a way to organize an Agile team. They come up with 

46
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,159
this two pizza size team which is four to nine people which is a 

47
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,162
good size so you don't spend too much time communicating. 

48
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:51,165
Scrums, the name comes from rugby which I played also. That's 

49
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:57,171
not why. Scrum is inspired by these short daily meetings. 

50
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,177
Fifteen minutes every day at the same place, you show up, like 

51
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,181
9:07 in the morning, you get there and you have a short meeting 

52
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,184
and you just go around the circle and answer three questions. 

53
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,187
The three questions are: what have you done since yesterday, 

54
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,191
what are you planning to do today, and are there any impediments 

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,195
or stumbling blocks there? You're going around in a circle and 

56
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,197
what the idea is is you try and help individuals on your team, 

57
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:26,201
in the Scrum and see if they have some obstacle and maybe you 

58
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,206
can do something to change what you're doing to help them 

59
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,208
overcome their obstacle or maybe you have some experience you 

60
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,211
can share. Hey, I've had that problem before and you do that. 

61
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,214
Every day, 15 minutes, what are you going to do each day? 

62
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:41,217
There's a couple of roles. There's the team which develops it, 

63
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,221
but then this person called the Scrum Master and that's the team 

64
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,225
member who does these followings things. He acts as a buffer or 

65
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,228
he or she acts as a buffer between the team and any kind of 

66
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,231
external distraction to try to keep the team focused, working on 

67
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,235
the things at hand rather than getting distracted and working on 

68
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,237
things besides the user stories you're supposed to. He or she 

69
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,241
enforces the team rules, like if you have a coding standard, 

70
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,244
make sure every body is sticking to the coding standard and if 

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,247
there's impediments in making progress, like access to data or 

72
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,251
software, the Scrum Master takes that on. The one other role is 

73
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,255
called the Product Owner. This is a team member whose not the 

74
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,258
Scrum Master, somebody else who represents the voice of the 

75
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:26,261
customer and helps prioritize user stories. We've got the Scrum 

76
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,266
Master to help keep the people in the right direction, the 

77
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,268
Product Owner. They're going to say, hey I don't know ... As the 

78
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,270
Product Owner, I don't think that's a good way to do this or I 

79
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:38,273
think this is more important than trying to push them to do 

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,278
this. We'll say it again, it's a good idea to rotate these 

81
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,281
roles. In this informal organization, certainly the Product 

82
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,285
Owner and quite possibly the Scrum Master. Now, one of the 

83
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,289
things that happened in teams is resolving conflicts. You know, 

84
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,292
there are different opinions on what's the right way to go on a 

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,295
particular technical issue. Let's talk about some ways to 

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,300
resolve these conflicts. One way is instead of starting with a 

87
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,305
disagreement, it's starting where you agree. Let's start off 

88
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:13,307
with listing all of the things where you agree and then maybe 

89
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,313
you're going to realize, well gee, we're not far apart. On these 

90
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,316
seven or eight things is one thing to differ, maybe it's not 

91
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:24,318
that big. Another way to do this is to articulate each other's 

92
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,324
arguments. Being in arguments, you swap roles. Even if you don't 

93
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,328
agree with it, you give the other argument of the other person 

94
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,332
and then, that other person switches roles and gives your 

95
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,334
argument back. What this does is it avoids confusion about the 

96
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,339
terms or assumptions. Maybe the reason of the argument is just 

97
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,341
you have different assumptions and once you understand each 

98
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:48,343
other's assumptions, that's the real cause of the conflict. 

99
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,348
Intel actually embraces conflicts. They have what they call 

100
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:57,352
constructive confrontation. If you have an Intel blue badger, an 

101
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,357
Intel employee, you are told in the first day that if you have a 

102
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,361
strong opinion that the person is proposing the wrong thing 

103
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,364
technically, not business, but technically. You are obligated to 

104
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,368
bring it up by your badge or I'll bring it up. Even if it's the 

105
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,370
President of the company. That's constructive confrontation. 

106
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,374
That sounds good. That causes lots of people to examine ideas. 

107
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,377
That could lead to problems. They also have another part of the 

108
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,381
culture is disagree and commit. Once decision is made, so 

109
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,385
there's two people. One is probably right, one is wrong, you 

110
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,389
need to go with that one, embrace it and go ahead and basically, 

111
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,392
what we say I still disagree. Basically, you're still wrong, but 

112
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,396
I disagree but I'm going to help even if I don't agree. I don't 

113
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
have to agree to help, but I have to help because I want to be a 

114
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,402
team member. As I think about these things, my wife and I 

115
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,405
celebrated our 46th wedding anniversary like Wednesday and 

116
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,409
there's a chance that this conflict stuff could be useful in a 

117
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:56,411
future career. There's a chance that when you get married, you 

118
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,416
may not always see eye to eye and if you could be good at 

119
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,418
resolving conflicts ... This is ... Software engineering 

120
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,421
improving your personal lives. Boy, you handle these conflicts 

121
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,425
so well. How did you do that? Well, I'm a software engineer so. 

122
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:16,429
Of course. Summarizing Scrum is basically a kind of a guidelines 

123
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,436
to self- organize the team, the big part of it is the stand- up 

124
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,439
15 minutes questions, 15 minute meetings where you answer these 

125
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,443
three questions, what did you do yesterday, what are you going 

126
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,446
to do today, and are there any obstacles and you've got these 

127
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,449
two roles, the Product Owner and Scrum Master that you rotate 

128
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,452
around, so everybody has as chance to do it.
