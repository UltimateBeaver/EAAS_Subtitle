1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Armando talked about forms. Let us add a form to fill in. How 

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,010
about a User Interface? If we are going to add a view for the 

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,015
user interface, we are going to have to add a route to connect 

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,017
it. Typically, there is usually a happy path and a sad path. Let 

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,022
us show it working and not working and see what happens. What we 

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:31,026
are going to do, our application is going to be ... it is hard 

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,031
to type all that stuff in, so there is this thing called The 

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,033
Movie Database, TMDb, probably all know about it. Instead of 

9
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,038
typing in what the new functionality we want to add, is populate 

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:48,042
the form directly from the TMDb so we are going to have the 

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
ability to search the TMDb from the Rotten Potatoes home page. 

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,051
We are going to need a LoFi User Interface and a storyboard to 

13
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,054
do that. We are going to put all the pieces together of what we 

14
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,057
are going to do in projects. Here is my attempt to do this. This 

15
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:06,061
is my LoFi UI for the Rotten Potatoes home page and we added a 

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,066
new movie from TMDb and here is the search button. In the happy 

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,070
path, that is, we find the movie, it comes down here and it 

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,075
fills in Inception and all the information you want and you 

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,078
click Add and you go back. In the sad path where it does not 

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,081
match, you get this message, No, sorry, could not have it and 

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,084
you could try it over again and search again. That is the happy 

22
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,087
path, sad path in the User Interface that we are going to do. 

23
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:36,091
Let us go over what the feature looks like using the cucumber 

24
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,096
format here above the feature. User can add a movie by searching 

25
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,099
in The Movie Database, TMDb. As a movie fan, I can add new 

26
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,103
movies without manual tedium. I want to add movies by looking up 

27
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,106
their details in TMDb. We are going to write down the sad path 

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,110
first. Let us try and add a movie that does not work. Given that 

29
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
I am on the Rotten Potatoes home page, then I should see " 

30
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,117
Search for a TMDb movie?" When I fill in " Search Terms", and we 

31
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,121
will make up a name of the movie, " The Movie That Does Not 

32
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,124
Exist", hopefully there is no movie with that name. That would 

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:11,126
be a bad name for a movie, probably. Then I press " Search TMDb" 

34
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,131
then I should be in the Rotten Potatoes home page and I should 

35
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,133
see " Movie That Does Not Exist" was not found on the TMDb. That 

36
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,137
is the sad path there. Now, let us try to figure out what we got 

37
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:27,142
to add to make this work. We are going to need to have a view 

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,147
for this. What we're going to have, that Armando just talked 

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,151
about this earlier, is we are going to do a form, where the 

40
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,154
action ... and we have to name a method that is going to handle 

41
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,157
the form ... we are going to call that 'search_ tmdb'[= form_ 

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
tag : action => 'search_ tmdb' do]. Here is the label for the 

43
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,164
form that we are going to create in haml [% label{: for => 

44
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,167
'search_ terms'} Search Terms. The next slide is what does this 

45
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,169
look like in html.
	= text_ field_ tag 'search_ terms'
	= 

46
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,171
submit_ tag 'Search TMDb This haml gets turned into this 

47
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,173
code:
	<lable for='search_terms'> Search 

48
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,175
Terms</label>
	<input id="search_terms" name="search_terms" type="text" /> 

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,176
This will be able to implement the form for us. That is the 

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,180
view. Now if you were to try it ... when we do try it, it will 

51
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,185
say it is missing the route, so I am just going to go through 

52
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:13,187
this slowly. We have to add a route in movies_ controller. rb. 

53
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:18,193
What we could do, it would be to build the method that can 

54
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,198
handle all this. Both ... when it fails, if it does not work, it 

55
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,202
will give an error message, but it can go out into TMD and find 

56
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:31,205
that. Unfortunately, what you would really do is start using 

57
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,211
Test Driven Development, which we have not talked about yet. 

58
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,214
What we will do right now is just do the sad path by having a 

59
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:41,217
fake method that is just going to always fail. This method will 

60
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,221
never find a movie, but it will let the sad path pass. What 

61
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,225
Armando will do in a couple of lectures sooner, he will 

62
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,228
implement the happy path, where it goes out and search TMDb. The 

63
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,232
problem is you go back and forth from BDD and TDD, but 

64
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,235
pedagogically, we have to them one at a time, so we will just do 

65
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:05,238
BDD today. This is going to be the route that we need to be able 

66
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,245
to make the connection. post '/ movies/ search_ tmdb' We are 

67
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,247
going to add this to routes. rb and then here is our dummy 

68
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,251
method, and you can see just what Armando talked about, we are 

69
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,254
going to use the flash.
	[ flash[ : warning] = " '{ params[: 

70
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,255
search_ terms]} '  was not found in TMDB. We are going to use it 

71
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,257
as a warning rather than notice and it is going to give the 

72
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,258
error message there and this is our method that we are going to 

73
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,262
do that.
