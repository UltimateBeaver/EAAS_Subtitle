1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
With that, they're ready for our cards again. All right, so what 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,004
about points, velocity and trackers too and comparing to team, 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,007
the one with the higher velocity is more productive. When you 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,010
don't know how to approach a given story, just give it three 

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,013
points. With Tracker, developers pick the user stories and mark 

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,017
as Accepted when done, and tracker helps prioritize and keep 

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,020
track of user stories and their status, calculate velocity, and 

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:01:16,023
predicts software development time. Any questions?
