1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's see about DBB and User Stories here. So which of these 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,004
questions is false? BDD is designed to help with validation, 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,008
build the right things in addition to verification, BDD should 

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,011
test app implementation. User Stories and BDD play the same role 

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,015
as design requirements and plan on document methods. And this is 

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
a valid User Story, search TMDB featured name and I want to 

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,022
search TMDB as a movie fan so that I can easily find 

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:36,026
information. So which of these things is false? Ready, set, 

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:41,036
vote. The first couple of rows are voting. Yes, there's some 

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,041
differences here, so talk this over and then ... talk it over 

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:53,044
and we'll do it again. All right. Let's vote again, let's vote 

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,053
again. Ready, set, cards up. Voting as pairs. Okay. It converged 

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
to green. Good. So BDD is designed to help with validation, 

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,060
that's correct. User Stories play the same role as design 

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:08,063
requirements planÂ [ inaudible 00:01:04] correct. The blue on 

16
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,068
which some people voted for the first time around it's just in a 

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,071
little bit different order but it's got all 3 terms, so it's 

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,073
okay. But BDD doesn't test the implementation, it tests the 

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,076
behavior, Behavior Driven Design. Okay. Good. So with that ...
