1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, let's try the [ inaudible 00:01]. Ready. Set. Vote. Let's 

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:07,002
see what colors we get. Lots of blues and oranges, so why don't 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:13,007
you talk it over. Ready. Set, let's vote as teams and see if the 

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:19,013
colors change and vote. it's a lot bluer than it was last time 

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,019
so let's see what it was. Explicit scenarios, starting with the 

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,023
second one, it's explicit scenarios usually capture integration 

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,026
tests. No, they're usually the acceptance test. This is the 

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,028
thing. The customer you talk about, you got it on a 3x5 card, 

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:36,031
that's probably an acceptance test. Declarative scenarios aim to 

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,036
capture implementation as well as behavior, their aiming at 

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
behavior, so people didn't vote for that one. The first one, 

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,043
explicit requirements are usually defined with imperative 

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,045
scenarios and implicit requirements. No, that was just like 

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
Armando last time, just put all the words together. There's no 

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,051
relationship between ... explicit/ implicit is orthogonal from 

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,055
declarative and imperative, so that's the other thing. The right 

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,059
answer was blue. All these are false. Any questions about that? 

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:05,065
Good.
