1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Which statement about teams in general is true? As compared to

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:11,006
scrum, plan and document, project managers act as both scrum 

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,011
master and the product owner. Teams should try to avoid 

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:19,014
conflicts at all costs. Plan and document processes can have 

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
much larger teams than scrum which then the members report 

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:27,022
directly to the project manager. As studies show that 84% to 90% 

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,027
of projects are on- time and on- budget, plan and document 

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,029
managers can promise customers a set of features for an agreed 

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:38,032
upon cost by an agreed upon date. Which statement is true? Okay, 

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:44,038
ready, set, vote. Alright, you should definitely talk this one 

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:51,044
over. Let's vote again and then we'll go over this. Ready, set, 

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,051
you should be voting as pairs. Okay, vote. It's red and orange, 

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,057
looks like [ down 00:00:58]. What are they? Teams should try to 

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,061
avoid ... let's do the greed one which somebody voted for. Teams 

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,063
should try to avoid conflicts at all costs. You guys got that 

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,067
right, that's false. Because while conflicts needs to be 

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,069
resolved they can be helpful in finding the best fast forward 

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:17,072
for a project. Blue was 84% of the projects are on- time. I'm 

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,077
still stunned that that's the fraction of things that are late. 

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,081
It's all based on being predictable and it's almost always not 

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:29,084
predictable. They do, but nevertheless, if you're then planning 

22
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,089
document manager, you go ahead and promise all these things. 

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,092
Yeah, it's going to be on time, it's going to cost this much and 

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,094
it's going to have all these features. Ninety percent of the 

25
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,097
time this doesn't work. What's left? Plan and document can have 

26
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,101
much larger teams than scrum which report directly to the plan 

27
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,104
and document manager. Yes, they do hierarchically. They have 

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,108
scrum sized teams but they put a bunch of them together and they 

29
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
could build a big hierarchy, a much bigger team. The plan and 

30
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
document managers do act as both the scrum master and the 

31
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,117
product owner. They deal with all the interactions with the 

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,120
customer so that they have the kit and they tell you what to do. 

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,126
Let me move ahead.
