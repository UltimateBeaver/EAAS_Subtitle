00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I said an instance method in a controller method for how long as 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:12,004
its value going to be retained? Read, think. Initial vote. I've 

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:20,012
ever surely decided you have long enough to think. Was I right? 

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,020
Take 30 seconds to discuss it. I was only partially right. All 

5
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:33,025
right, let's vote second time. Second vote, hold them up. Okay, 

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,033
wide convergence on red. Let's go through this one at a time. If 

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,038
I said an instance variable in a controller method, all right 

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,040
that's key phrase in there, instance variable to controller 

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,042
method. Your tip off here is the controller is really just the 

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,045
receiving end of an HTTP request. HTTP is stateless. You keep 

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,049
coming back to this over and over. Once the controller method 

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,052
has done its work ... What is the controller? The controller is 

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,056
an instance of object. It's an instance of the controller object 

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,059
that handles an incoming HTTP request. As soon as that 

15
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,062
controller object has finished doing its job, that instance of 

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,066
the controller evaporates along with all of the instance 

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,068
variables. Instance variables used ones, they're gone. Once 

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,072
you've consumed them to view, you can say goodbye to them 

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
forever. Now, there are special cases like the flash and the 

20
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,077
session. There's a reason to persist some information from one 

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,081
request to another, which is why those things have a separate 

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,083
obstruction like the flash and session. Only this request and 

23
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,087
the next request that will be to review put something into the 

24
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,089
flash. Which again looks like a hash, quacks like hash, but it 

25
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,092
persist one request after the current one. If you put it into 

26
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,096
the session it would indeed stick around for all subsequent 

27
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,098
requests. As long as you didn't make your session so bloated, 

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,101
that it doesn't fit in a cookie. Red is correct, and for the 

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,105
blue one, if you voted blue it say you're on 169 now and no more 

30
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,108
Java. In fact I'm not even sure the statement makes sense in 

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,110
Java. There's no declaration, there's no static and if there 

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,113
were, they'll be class variables and not instance variables. I 

33
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,115
just tried to see how many different key words I could put in 

34
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,117
there to make it not makes sense. Every time you hit your 

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,120
application with a new HTTP request, each incoming new request 

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,124
causes a new instance of the controller object to be created. 

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,127
Just as with any type of object, whenever an instance of an 

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,130
object is blown away, all of the instance variables associated 

39
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,133
with that instance are also blown away. That is exactly the 

40
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,135
explanation.
