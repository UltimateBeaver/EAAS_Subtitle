00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today's the day for, " Which statement is NOT true about." So, " 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,004
Which statement is NOT true about RESTful routes and the 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,007
resources that they refer to?" " A resource could be existing 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,010
content, or it could be a request to modify something." " In a 

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,014
Model- View- Controller app, every route must eventually trigger 

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:21,017
some controller action." " One common set of RESTful actions 

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,021
that you might want to support is, CRUD actions on your models, 

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,024
whether they're ActiveRecord or not." And, " The route always 

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,027
contains one or more wildcards, like ": id", because it needs to 

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,031
identify the particular resource involved in that operation." So 

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:39,034
think about that for a moment. Okay, so the initial vote. Okay, 

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,039
initial vote. Wow, okay, the initial vote is almost 

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,041
overwhelmingly for blue. You guys are so smart that we're going 

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,044
to just review why blue is the right answer. So, why is blue the 

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
correct answer is this case? Well, we can look at the first 

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,051
three, and basically rule out all the other ones. A resource 

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,054
could be existing content, or a request to make a change to 

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
content. We've seen examples of both, so that's true. Every 

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,060
route must eventually trigger a controller action, that, yes, in 

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,062
a properly- designed Model- View- Controller app, that's the 

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,065
description, the job description of the controller is, " Handle 

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,068
the incoming requests from users." So, yes, sensibly enough, 

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,071
controllers must eventually be triggered when the user asks to 

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
do something. One common set of RESTful actions are, the CRUD 

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,077
actions on models. Absolutely. In fact, as we just showed, those 

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,081
are the ones for which Rails provides you, for free, routes that 

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,083
will already do the correct things. Which leaves only the last 

28
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,087
one, that the route always contains one or more wildcard 

29
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,089
parameters. That's only true if the action is one that could 

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,092
operate on a particular element of a large collection. So, one 

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,096
action is, " Show me information about a specific movie." In a 

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,099
route like that, you would need to have a parameter to say which 

33
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,102
movie it was, but, as we say, another resource could be, " Show 

34
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,105
me the whole list of movies." You don't need a particular 

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,108
identifier for that, you just need a constant string. So, the 

36
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
last choice is the one that is false, and you're all really 

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,114
smart, because you got it right.
