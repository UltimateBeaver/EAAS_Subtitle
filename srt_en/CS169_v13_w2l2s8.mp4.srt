00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's an example for you try. Which string will not appear as

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,005
a result of running this code, that's assuming the code runs it 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,008
all? Perhaps the code has some syntax error and won't actually 

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:21,011
run. Take a look at the code for a moment and think it over. By 

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,021
the way, match is a regular expression. Yeah, we got to do a 

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:29,023
first vote, I forgot. Vote. I think that's orange, right? Based 

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:37,029
on the lighting, is that orange? Since you guys are so quick, 

8
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,037
let's go talk through the answers here. What's happening in this 

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
expression? We've got an array of three things and when we call 

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,043
map, what is map going to do? It actually returns another 

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,045
collection, right? It's going to take this anonymous function 

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
and it's going to apply it to each of the elements and return a 

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,051
new collection with those application. What's inside the 

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,054
function body? It takes an element and it calls reverse on it. 

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
We've seen that string. reverse will reverse a string so what 

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,060
we're getting out of here is ananab, anana, isn't that cool that 

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,065
I picked a palindrome and naan which is another palindrome, 

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,069
three great foods by the way. The middle one means pineapple in 

19
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:17,071
Spanish. At this point, after the word end, that's where we are. 

20
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,077
We've got a new collection that has the three strings but each 

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,079
one of them has been reversed. Within that collection we're 

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,082
going to select, in other words filter for all of the ones that 

23
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:31,086
match a regular expression that begins with A. Ananab and anana 

24
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,091
will fit that criteria and naan does not fit that criteria so it 

25
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,094
will not appear and therefore orange is the correct answer. Well 

26
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:37,097
done.
