1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Which statements do you think are true regarding behavior- 

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,003
driven development and test- driven development: that 

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:09,005
requirements drive the implementation, that BDD and TDD are used 

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,009
only in Agile, or that they are designed to embrace and deal 

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:19,013
with change? Initial votes? Okay we have a majority opinion here 

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
for red, but there is by no means unanimous. Take about 30 

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:29,022
seconds. Let's vote again, and we have convergence on red. Red 

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,029
is correct. Certainly, requirements drive the implementation 

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,033
both from the features you wished you had and the code you 

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,035
wished you had. That's your starting point. In both cases, that 

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,037
is certainly true. They can be used only in Agile development. 

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,041
No, that's not true. That's where they came from, because it's a 

13
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,043
very convenient way to quickly iterate over new features, but 

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,046
there's nothing stopping you from first going to the customer, 

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,048
getting a whole volume of features, going off for six months 

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,052
implementing those features, coming back and having the customer 

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,054
tell you they changed their mind. You're free to do that. B is 

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
not correct. You can use these outside of Agile, but they fit 

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,060
very well with Agile. That's where they came from. Lastly c, 

20
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,063
that they embrace and deal with change. They certainly do, 

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,066
because if you're actually doing a feature at a time or if 

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,068
you're doing one set of functionality at a time, that gives you 

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,071
small increments to make progress so you don't take a big risk 

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
in building a lot of code that may or may not be what the 

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,077
customer actually turns out to want.
