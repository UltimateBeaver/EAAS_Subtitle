00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next thing you need to do when you meet with a customer besides 

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,002
coming up with the user’ s stories, is work on the user 

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:09,004
interface. Why? Because most SaaS applications have a user 

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,009
interface. There’ s a piece in the cloud. There’ s a piece on 

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:17,012
the browser typically. What can we do to get the customer to 

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:23,017
participate, like the 3 x 5 cards? We want to avoid the WISBNWIW 

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:28,023
user interface. Everybody knows what that is. The WISBNWIW 

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,028
interface, that’ s the, what I said but not what I want user 

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,031
interface. You don’ t want to build the user interface as far as 

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,035
you can tell just what the customer asked for, and then once the 

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,038
customer sees this, “ No, no, no. That’ s not what I want.” We 

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,042
want to avoid that thing. So what’ s the user interface 

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,045
equivalent of that? Then that’ s kind of you could imagine some 

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
kind of picture that you create, like Photo Shop user interface 

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,051
that way, but a user interface is active. It’ s animated. Many 

16
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,056
things are going on. How do we reflect that into what make it 

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,059
easy to change? The answer is you’ ve already learned this in 

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:07,062
kindergarten. We do user interface sketches with pen and paper 

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,067
or with crayons. You could do it with the crayons, and you make 

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:15,069
what’ s called the Lo- Fi, low fidelity user interface. Here’ s 

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,075
one that I did, so you can see at the top of this page is rotten 

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,079
potatoes, and we’ re creating a new movie. I left some blanks, 

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,083
some forms to fill in for the title, rating, release date, and 

24
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,087
here’ s a button at the bottom where they save the changes. 

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,091
That’ s my sketch. That took me very little time to sketch, and 

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,095
we could show it, and because it’ s not threatening like 3 x 5 

27
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,098
cards, “ No, no, no, that’ s not what I want”, we could just 

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,100
throw the pieces away or do it on a white board and take 

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:46,102
pictures of it. It’ s really low tech, but we can get an idea of 

30
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,106
what’ s going on. That’ s like a statistic one. What about this 

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,109
animated when you click on it? Well, once again the user 

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,113
interface community came up with another good idea, which is 

33
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,116
storyboards, which they borrowed from the movie industries. You’ 

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
ve probably all seen movies about movies where you see these 

35
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,121
storyboards, like for Disney, and here’ s how the scene is put 

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,124
together. It’ s like the scenes of a movie, but instead of 

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:12,127
linear, like pieces of a movie, we can go to anyone. So let’ s 

38
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:17,132
go look at the storyboard version of this examples. This one is 

39
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:23,137
a mock up of a page that when I click on add a new movie, this 

40
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,143
arrow says, this page is supposed to pop up. That was the one I 

41
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,145
showed you before. What happens after I save changes, it’ s 

42
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,149
supposed to go to this page, which shows the movie being added, 

43
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,153
and then I can click back to the movies and go over there. It’ s 

44
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,156
multiple of these Lo- Fi sketches and with some arrows to show 

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,160
how it works. That’ s storyboards. Believe it or not, with 

46
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,163
pieces of paper and storyboards and dealing with the customer 

47
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,166
that you can help evolve, at very little effort, figure out what 

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,170
the customer wants and likes and be happy before you build it. 

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,176
It seemed kind of a lot of work, but it’ s a lot less work than 

50
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:05,179
producing html, and again, not threatening, engage the customer 

51
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:11,185
more. After this, we talked a little bit about Haml, and Armando 

52
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,191
did talk about Cascade Style Sheet, CSS, so it’ s important to 

53
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,195
make it pretty, but after you figure out what they want. You 

54
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,198
don’ t want to make it pretty and then we throw it away. That’ s 

55
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,201
the idea of Lo- FI UI, and as you meet with the customers and 3 

56
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:30,205
x 5 cards, as soon as you get tired of talking about that, you 

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,210
could start talking about the user interface and the storyboards 

58
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,213
and how they would work.
