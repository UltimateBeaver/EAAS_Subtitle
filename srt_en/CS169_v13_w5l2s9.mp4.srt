1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay. Now that we understand where we're going, and yes, we are 

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,003
going to have to implement a controller method that is the first 

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:09,005
place that external user input touches our code. So yeah, that's 

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,009
we're going to code next, and this gives us an opportunity to 

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,011
sort of do the cycle that so far has been provided for you in 

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,015
the homeworks which is the Red, Green, Refactor cycle. So here's 

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,018
the basic approach, we're going to think about one thing the 

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,020
code should do. In fact, in the last little segment there, we 

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,023
just came up with three things the code should do. We're going 

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,026
to capture that thought in a test, which fails because we have 

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,029
no code, and then we're going to write the simplest thing we can 

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,031
think of in the code that makes that test pass. Before 

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,034
continuing on to the next behavior, we'll just see whether 

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,037
there's any opportunity to sort of clean up or refactor or 

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,040
beautify the code that we are already wrote. Then we're going to 

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,042
have a lot to say about refactoring later on in the course, but 

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,046
it's kind of like it's always refactoring time. Right? You 

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
should never miss an opportunity to do a little bit of code 

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,051
cleanup. The cycle's called Red, Green, Refactor because you go 

20
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,054
from Red, which if failing; to Green, which is passing; to 

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
Refactoring, which is still passing but with an improved code 

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,060
structure and you keep doing that sort of until the code passes 

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,063
all the test that you have thought of. So you're goal is to 

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,065
always have working code. Whenever you write a new test, it's 

25
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,068
going to fail. That's like unstable situation that you want to 

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,071
get away from. You want to get back to green. So that's why the 

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
simplest possible code that makes sense it pass, that's that 

28
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,077
path of least resistance. Right? You have a separate opportunity 

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
to beautify or refactor the code, but the most important thing 

30
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,083
is ... don't get too far away from stuff that works. If it's not 

31
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:32,087
broke, don't fix it. The question is ... if we're going to start 

32
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,092
doing unit level testing, we have to test things in isolation, 

33
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,094
right? We said that there's this spectrum of testing from 

34
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,097
testing one method or one class at a time all the way up to the 

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,100
integration test, which exercise big chunks of the app many code 

36
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,103
paths. So the basic question we're going to look at next is, how 

37
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,106
do you test something in isolation? Given that sort of any non- 

38
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,109
trivial piece of code has dependencies on other things that 

39
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:59,112
would affect how you would test it. So the powerful tool that 

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
we're going to use here is the code you wish you have. Maybe 

41
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,121
it's the code we wish we have, I don't know. But we already 

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,124
said, " What should the controller method do that receives the 

43
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,126
search form [ molds 00:02:06]?" Let's just start with our own 

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,128
answer to that question was it should call a method that will 

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,130
search TMDb for the specified movie for the specified movie. 

46
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,133
Now, we have no clue under the sun of what that method is going 

47
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,135
to look like. In fact, all we really know about that method 

48
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,138
based on the last self- check question is that that method is 

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,140
actually going to live in the model. So really, the only thing 

50
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,143
controller has to do ... is kind of pass the buck to the model, 

51
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,146
right? We have to make sure that whatever user data comes from 

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,149
the app, that what's going to arrive in the controller, so 

53
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,151
somehow that data has to successfully get to whatever method in 

54
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,155
the model is going to do the actual work. Right? I think we're 

55
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,157
in agreement about that after the last question. The question is 

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,161
how do we test this controller method if we've already admitted 

57
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,164
to ourselves that it depends on this other code in the model, 

58
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,167
which we haven't even thought about yet. So this is where the 

59
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,170
powerful idea of the code we wish we had comes in. Let's 

60
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,173
remember we have to add a route to config/ routes. rb. That's 

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,176
not a problem, we can do a simple route that just posts a form 

62
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,179
to the search_ tmdb [ inaudible 00:03:00], not a problem there. 

63
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,182
We already know that because of convention over configuration 

64
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,184
rails will map that and it will look for an action called 

65
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,187
search_ tmdb in our movies controller, that's while I'm good. 

66
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,190
Again, we get that kind of for free. Well, the view has to have 

67
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,193
something to render, so for now, we'll just create an empty 

68
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,195
view. That's perfectly legal. Not useful, but it will allow our 

69
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,198
test to pass. So, we just create an empty Haml file that has the 

70
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,201
correct name and is in the correct place. Right? This is just 

71
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,203
all scaffolding, so that the world doesn't blow up when we start 

72
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,206
doing our test. And now, we're going to get to the actual. We're 

73
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,209
going to look at that " hardwired" fake method that Dave used in 

74
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,212
his example and we're going to replace it with an empty method. 

75
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,214
Okay? So now, we're pulling out the safety net. The method is 

76
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:44,218
now officially going to have to fail. Since I just said ... we'd 

77
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,224
agreed that the controller has to hand off some data to the 

78
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,227
model and the model is going to have a method that does the 

79
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,229
actual work, but what method is that? I mean, we haven't written 

80
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,232
that method yet. So, how could we possibly test the controller 

81
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,235
action if the thing that it's supposed to call doesn't exist 

82
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,238
yet. This is the magic part. Okay? So, the way we resolve this 

83
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,243
is we'll say, " No problem. Let's develop an idea for the code 

84
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,247
we wish we had." In other words, we know that code doesn't exist 

85
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,251
but suppose it did exist. How would we like it to work? We will 

86
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,255
use a seam, a seam is a really important concept. It's basically 

87
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,258
a place where we can change the behavior of our app without 

88
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,261
changing source code. When we come back to this and talk and 

89
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,263
separately about it. But we're going to insert a seam that 

90
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,266
allows us to test the code we wish we had even though that code 

91
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,269
isn't there yet. So, here's the code that I would say we wish we 

92
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,271
had. We know that it's going to be a class [ method 00:04:34] of 

93
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,275
movie, so I postulate that it be nice if we had a method called 

94
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,276
find_ in_ tmdb that it's a class method of movie and that it can 

95
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
take some arguments representing the mood that it's going to try 

96
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,282
to look up in the TMDB database. So, here is our game plan, 

97
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,285
we're going to simulate in our test what happened when the user 

98
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,288
post that search form. We're going to check that when the 

99
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:56,291
controller action gets invoked, it tries to call find_ in_ tmdb 

100
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,296
and that it correctly includes the data that it had pulled out 

101
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,298
of the submitted form. Now, these are useful things to test. 

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,300
Right? We are not testing the find_ in_ tmdb function itself. 

103
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,304
We're not testing that it can talk to the external database. The 

104
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,307
only thing we're testing is that controller is doing it's job 

105
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,309
which is separate from the model doing its job. Okay? So, of 

106
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,313
course, the test will fail because we just made the controller 

107
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,316
method be empty, and then we'll backfill the controller method 

108
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,319
so that it makes the test pass. We could do all of that without 

109
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,322
ever actually writing the model method. So, how would we do 

110
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:31,325
this? So, let's walk through, this is our ... controller spec, 

111
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,331
and as we've already seen, we have a describe block for the 

112
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,334
overall class whose behavior we're describing and then within 

113
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,337
that describe block, we can nest other describe blocks that are 

114
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,339
sort of testing different chunks of behavior within that class. 

115
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,343
Here's our test case that says the controller action should call 

116
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,347
the model method that performs the actual search, does the real 

117
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,350
work. We're saying ... first of all, we're going to set up this 

118
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,353
expectation. The movie class should receive the method call, 

119
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,357
find_ in_ tmdb with particular movie title. Right? So remember I 

120
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,361
said the game plan is we're going to simulate posting the form 

121
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,363
with some data, make sure the controller action can correctly 

122
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,366
get that data and hand it off. Well, here is our simulated post. 

123
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,370
Post is one of the methods that's included like the rails plug 

124
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,373
ins for our specs, so that there convenient ways to simulate 

125
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,376
things in the model of new controllers. So, post is a method 

126
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,378
that says take code ... what controller are we testing? It's the 

127
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,381
movies controller. So to that controller, post this action and 

128
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,386
it can lookup in the routes. rb what [ inaudible 00:06:28.] 

129
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,388
require to simulate that post and here's what's going to be 

130
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,392
passed in [ params 00:06:32]. So, this is the one place that we 

131
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,395
have to sort of synthesize something is we have to know what [ 

132
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,397
params 00:06:38] would look like when the user actually submits 

133
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,401
that form. There's many ways you can do that. I showed one 

134
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,404
example is you can put a debugger statement in your controller 

135
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,406
method and sort of take a look at the [ params 00:06:48.] object 

136
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,409
and see what the form actually looks like when it arrives. Any 

137
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,411
of those methods is good. Right? So, what are we doing here? Our 

138
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,414
two steps is we're setting up an expectation of something that 

139
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:01,416
should happen, and then, we're executing some code that should 

140
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:07,421
trigger that thing to happen. Right? So, why is this work? 

141
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,427
Here's a self- check [ inaudible 00:07:08] let's see how far we 

142
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,430
get without me sort of revealing all the details here of what's 

143
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,433
going on. Just to test your intuition about what that example is 

144
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,438
trying to show. So, should receive is one of our specs methods 

145
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,442
and see if you can use your intuition to answer the following. 

146
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,445
Which of these statements is false regarding should_ receive? 

147
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,448
One of the statement is should receive provide a stand- in for 

148
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,452
real method that doesn't exist yet, so that we can do our test? 

149
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,455
Another statement is ... even if we did have that real method, 

150
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,458
should receive would override it for the purpose of our test? A 

151
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,462
third possibility is should receive could be either issued 

152
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,466
before or after the code that should trigger the behavior that 

153
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,470
should receive [ sets up 00:07:51]. Or fourth, that it exploits 

154
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,474
Ruby's open classes and metaprogramming to create that should 

155
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,476
receive seam. To create the place where we're going to try to 

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,480
sort of change and spy on the behavior or our application 

157
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,483
without changing the application's actual source code. So, I 

158
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,486
guarantee that one of these four statements actually is false. 

159
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,489
It is not a trick question.
