1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The most exciting part is let's get them rolling here. Let's get 

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:12,006
Cucumber and Capybara moving. This is what's called ... it's 

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,012
another fun part of this tool. It's incredibly magic. It's 

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,015
colorful; it's a very colorful tool. It colors the steps when 

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
you use them, so green means the step passed. This is of your 

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,022
scenario, right. The green steps pass, yellow means you haven't 

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,025
implemented it yet, red means it failed, and if it fails it's 

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,029
going to stop there so all the steps afterwards it's going to 

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,032
color it blue. The goal is to make this red- yellow- green 

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,035
analysis. You want to make all your steps green. Make all your 

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,038
steps green and the story is the girlfriend of the guy who came 

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,043
up with this tool decided that to make it all green then 

13
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,047
cucumber would be a cool vegetable to name it after because you 

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,051
want to make everything green. I guess maybe she's vegan or 

15
00:00:53,053 --> 00:01:01,053
something like that. Now we're going to do a live demo with 

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,061
Cucumber here, our cuc as it's called. There's a screen test 

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,065
that you can look on but we will see if the video lets me do the 

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:15,069
demo. What we're going to do is do ‘ add movie. '  This is the 

19
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:20,075
one we saw before and I'll show it to you in the editor here. 

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
This is what we're going to try and we'll start off trying to 

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:29,084
run Cucumber on this thing, and we put this in the features' 

22
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,089
directory and this is addmovie. features. Let's go to Cucumber 

23
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,093
and you see under the command Cucumber, Features, Add Movie and 

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,097
let's see what happens. Presumably, since we're doing the red- 

25
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:46,101
yellow- green analysis, this better not be all green and it's 

26
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,106
not. It says right here at the bottom we did one scenario that 

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,110
failed. There were eight steps there, one failed and seven were 

28
00:01:53,113 --> 00:02:01,113
skipped and now we scroll up the screen. Here it is, it says, " 

29
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,121
Given I am on the rotten potatoes' homepage," and this is in red 

30
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,124
so it failed and here's the other message, " I can't find the 

31
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,127
mapping from the rotten potatoes' homepage to a path," right. 

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,130
That's what we should be doing to associate that, not only that. 

33
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,135
This is like a navigator. It doesn't just say, " You made a 

34
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,138
mistake. Here it is," it says, " Now here's how you fix it, 

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:27,141
Dave. Dave go add a mapping to the paths. rb to fix that missing 

36
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,147
path," so it not only found what was wrong it tells you what to 

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,150
go do, so let's do that. That's the Cucumber page and so paths. 

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,157
rb, it gives you the full directory name there but that's over 

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,160
here, and let me go back. I almost forgot. This is what it wants 

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,165
to find so I'll make a copy of this. That's what I'm going to 

41
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,170
have here on my ‘ when' condition. I'm going to copy that now 

42
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,175
and let me go to paths. rb and here's where it is. It says here 

43
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,179
in the file add more mappings here. You can see here's an 

44
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,183
example, here's a ‘ when' condition and here's the regular 

45
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,186
expression with the hat, meaning the beginning of the line. 

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:15,189
We're going to copy that line, put the paths. rb, so I do that. 

47
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,195
Now I'm going to want to add this path to figure that out like 

48
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:31,199
Armando showed earlier. I'm going to run rake routes, okay, and 

49
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,211
this is going to list what's on the page so this is the index 

50
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,215
action. Here's the command ‘ get, '  so here's the path that I 

51
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:44,218
want which is ( slash) / movies. Again I copy that. I go to 

52
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:51,224
paths. rb and I add that after this with the quotes around it, 

53
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:56,231
right there, okay. Cuc found the message and then told me where 

54
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:03,236
to go fix it and I used rake routes to do that. Let me go to the 

55
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,243
end there. Let me just clear the screen so it doesn't get 

56
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:13,246
confusing. Let's try it again and it found a mistake. Let's try 

57
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:19,253
and do our red- yellow- green analysis and see if hopefully we 

58
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:24,259
made some progress, and it said, " Look" at the bottom again. 

59
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,264
The scenario failed. We have eight steps, two passed this time, 

60
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,267
one failed and the rest were skipped. This one's got a pretty 

61
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:37,271
big error message. It should be very similar to this one. When 

62
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,277
I'm on the rotten potatoes' homepage and I add a new movie, then 

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,280
I should be on the Create New Page, movie page. It says, " I 

64
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,284
can't find the mapping from Create New Movie page to path," and 

65
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,287
this kind of reminds me of a navigator, when you're going in the 

66
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,289
car and navigating and you don't follow it after a while. 

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,293
Doesn't it seem like it starts getting mad at you? " Come on, 

68
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,295
turn right." " Dave damn it, go add a mapping to the rotten 

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,300
potatoes' homepage with the thing." Tell me what to do. I'm 

70
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,305
going to make a copy. Now let's go to path. Again I'm going to 

71
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:25,309
want to say ‘ when' in the beginning of the line in the Create 

72
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:31,325
Movie Page. When I'm on the Create Movie Page, now let me go 

73
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,331
back to the rake routes and this time I'm doing new right here, 

74
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:42,334
and this is the path I need, movies/ new, so let me copy it. I 

75
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:47,342
go to paths. rb. Let me add that. What we've done is added a 

76
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:53,347
user story around an existing something that worked. We were 

77
00:05:53,353 --> 00:06:01,353
just having an extra test to see if it worked. Let's see what 

78
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:08,361
Cucumber says. Let me clear it again, run it to see if it's 

79
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:27,368
happy now. Green, one scenario, one passed, all eight steps 

80
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:32,387
passed and you see it's green analysis so cool as a cucumber, so 

81
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:39,392
to say. Okay It was already existing. We didn't add any new 

82
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,399
features. We didn't add new functionality to the app. We just 

83
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,403
added a test to make sure it could do that and that we could 

84
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,406
see, and then we added Men In Black. It really showed up.
