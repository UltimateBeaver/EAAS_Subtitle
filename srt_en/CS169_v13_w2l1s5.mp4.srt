1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, at the end of every chapter, we have a Fallacies and

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:07,003
Pitfalls section. We do a couple of those. The idea of fallacies 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,007
is it sounds right, but it's wrong and here's why it's wrong. 

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,009
Pitfalls are these things that are warning you, learn from our 

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,012
experience, and even though you're being warned, you can't help 

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:20,015
but fall into these pitfalls. So the Agile life cycle is best 

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,020
for software development. It's good for some things especially 

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,024
softwares and service. I don't think NASA should be doing this 

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,028
for moon shots or if you're doing something that's regulated by 

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,031
the law, it's not the right thing that ... For you to do. It 

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,035
doesn't have that flexibility that change. What we're going to 

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,039
do is practice Agile. One valid way to do this is you get a lot 

13
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,043
of good practices, but you're going to see the alternative like 

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,045
we talked about today, we're always ... Every time we bring up a 

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,048
topic, requirement solicitation, we're going to show you the 

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,050
other way to do it so you'll have a broader background. You'll 

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,054
deploy using Agile. You know, people ... When we talk to these 

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
companies, like you wanted to sell a couple of things that Agile 

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,060
is not used there. The other thing that I want to tell you is if 

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,062
you're going to stick to this as a profession, you're going to 

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,065
see new life cycles. New things are coming along every 10 or 15 

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,068
years, new platforms and things and it'll be a different life 

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,072
cycle than what we're talking in this class and you need to be 

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:19,074
able to adapt, learn new life cycles so just keep that in mind. 

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,079
Pitfall is ignoring the cost of software design since 

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,083
manufacturing cost is 0 for software. It seems like it wouldn't 

27
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,087
cost that much to remanufacture it, but you're forgetting the 

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,090
time for design and test when you do that. I can't help but 

29
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,097
think is this idea, well, if it's free to manufacture then it's 

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,100
okay to steal it is explains a lot of behavior for all kinds of 

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,104
piracy of things. This is an idea that no one should have to pay 

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,107
for development and since some of you are going to be software 

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,110
engineers, you should ... Before paying for software 

34
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:58,113
development, that that's going to pay service. Okay, so wrapping 

35
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,118
up this first chapter in this segment. This is what Armando and 

36
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,122
I called the Virtuous Triangle. I think we ... I originally 

37
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,125
called it the Golden Triangle, but we found out that that was a 

38
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:13,127
cocaine region. It's some kind of golden triangle. It wasn't 

39
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,133
good. Virtuous Triangle. These three things fit together 

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,137
synergistically here. SaaS on Cloud computing and as of the 

41
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,142
moment, how they fit together? Well, this allows the customer as 

42
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,145
you're developing it to see it immediately. You'll be dealing 

43
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,148
with your customer when you have these meetings and the customer 

44
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,151
will be trying it out and trying it. SaaS on Cloud computing in 

45
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:40,154
this highly productive frameworks like rails. Well, those design 

46
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,160
patterns, what kind of architecture support built in their 

47
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,163
framework that matches the needs of software, and finally, here 

48
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,165
at the bottom Agile development in these highly productive tools 

49
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,168
and frameworks. What's great about teaching this class is rather 

50
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,172
we just get hey, you should be doing this. We can give you tools 

51
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,175
to help you do this and we can see you using the tools and give 

52
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,179
you feedback on the tools. This has been a very important 

53
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,182
synergy here.
