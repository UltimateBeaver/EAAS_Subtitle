1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, vote. Vote, vote, vote. Statements that are false ... 

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
okay, we're just going to go through it. Most people got this 

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,009
right. I should have guessed that a crowd that has done a fair 

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,013
amount of programming would certainly not buy into number 3, 

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,016
that testing eliminates the need to use a debugger and indeed, 

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,019
you're right about that. Testing does not eliminate the need to 

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,021
use of debugger. However, what I hope that I've persuaded you of 

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,025
is that it eliminates many unproductive uses of a debugger. 

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,028
Sometimes you really will be in a quandary as to why your simple 

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,031
test case and your simple code are not behaving the way you 

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,033
should and that's when the debugger comes out but you shouldn't 

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,035
be using it for most of that. Most of your actual debugging 

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,038
really should be in the form of writing tests that fail. That's 

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,040
your bug. Then you write the code that fixes the bug. As we'll 

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,044
see when we talk about how you close out bugs in other people's 

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,047
code, it's actually the same process. All of these ideas are 

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,050
going to come back when we do bug fixing, when we do legacy code 

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,053
refactoring, all this stuff, the idea of test cases that cover 

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,056
you knowing that that's the target of where you're going to 

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,059
focus your bug fixing efforts. We're going to see this over and 

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,061
over again.
