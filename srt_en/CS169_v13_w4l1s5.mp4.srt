1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right. Next step in Behavior Driven Design, how are going to 

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:11,005
keep track of our projects. So this seems kind of an [ inaudible 

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:16,011
00:00:12] Agile, this loosey goosey soft development within 

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,016
formal teams and the Scrum teams and all that. How are we going 

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
to plan this in Agile? How are we going to estimate time if 

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,022
there's now plan and can we use User Stories? That seems like a 

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,026
big problem and if we could use User Stories, what would be the 

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:34,029
tool that we would use? So when measuring productivity, if we 

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,034
try to use User Stories per week, the problem is ... that seems 

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,037
right but the problem is some of them are much harder than 

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,039
others. So if you got 1 hard User Story done versus 3 simple 

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:48,043
ones, are you doing well or not? So what's the rocket science 

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,048
solution to this? What we'll do is we'll just assign point to 

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,052
each User Story. Okay. How about 1 for straight forward, 2 for 

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,056
medium and 3 for complicated. All right. And that's the big idea 

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,060
here instead of just counting User Stories we'll count points 

17
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,063
and the team will make up the points per User Story. And what 

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,067
velocity is which we've mentioned a few times since it's on the 

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:14,069
slide is just the average number of points a team completes per 

20
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,074
week. So the kind of the simple beauty of this system is you 

21
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,078
come up with points for your team, you estimate your stories and 

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,082
then your team figures out how many of your points you complete 

23
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,085
per week and then given your historical average of how many of 

24
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,089
the points that you assessed the User Stories you can guess how 

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,091
much work ... how long it will take you to finish the rest of 

26
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,094
the User Stories you want to do. So that's the big idea. So how 

27
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,097
do you actually assign the points? So typically we start off 

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,101
with 1, 2, 3, that's a good place to start, after [ inaudible 

29
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,104
00:01:43] you might have 5 and even 8 so the Pivotal Labs people 

30
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,108
which will code here, the Fibonacci Scale is what they use and 

31
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,113
even Pivotal Labs, the companies been doing this for many years, 

32
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,116
8 is extremely rare. How do you actually assign it? When you get 

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,120
together your daily Scrum you talk about the User Story and 

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,123
there it goes 1, 2, 3 and hold up fingers right? And then you 

35
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,127
just average them, what they do. Is it 2 or 3 or stuff like 

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,130
that. Now if 1 person says 2 which is kind of medium and one 

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,134
person says 5 which is really hard, you don't just average 

38
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,138
those, what you do is you stop and ... there's a disagreement 

39
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,141
over here. This is one of the things we talked about. There's 

40
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,144
some difference in assumptions, some difference in experience 

41
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,147
that makes them think wow, this is going to be really easy and 

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,150
this is going to be pretty hard. And so you want to talk this 

43
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:38,153
out before you go [ inaudible 00:02:34]. Our advise is that if 

44
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,158
anything is more than 5 you should divide the simpler stories. 

45
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,161
You don't want this big monster on the backlog that nobody wants 

46
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,165
to work on is going to take so long, so break it up into smaller 

47
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,168
stories as you go ahead. And like I said, velocity is a self- 

48
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,172
assessment. It helps you figure out how fast your team, the work 

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,176
spends your points, it's like you're on currency and as long as 

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,180
you're consistent overtime, it doesn't matter if you're doing 5 

51
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,182
points per week or 10 points or if you want to feel better you 

52
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,185
can make the points ... give yourself a lot of points. Really [ 

53
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,187
'pop wow' 00:03:08] we're doing 30 points a week. Yes, you can 

54
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,191
feel ... go to the bar and brag it to your friends. But it's a 

55
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,194
self- evaluation. As long as your consistent and it helps you 

56
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,197
predict what you're doing and it gives you insight, that's what 

57
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,201
you need to do. Now, once again, so this are pretty simple 

58
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,205
ideas. But wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to calculate 

59
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,208
this all by ourselves or wouldn't it be great if there was a 

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:36,210
tool that helped ... that keeps track of the User Stories is. So 

61
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,216
this company Pivotal Lab built this tool called Pivotal Tracker 

62
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,219
and it's just beekeeping for User Stories, but as long as you're 

63
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,222
doing the bookkeeping of how many User Stories you're finishing 

64
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,225
and there's points associated with these User Story, we could 

65
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,228
calculate your velocity for you and if you put in things like 

66
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,232
when you want to release something we could guess how long 

67
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,234
that's going to take. So this little bit difficult to see window 

68
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,238
here what the Pivotal Tracker which is this ... Armando 

69
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,242
mentioned it last time is this tool that runs on 1 database at 

70
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,244
this lab that handles all the projects in the world, it's not 

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,247
that heavy of load, it had the web browser inter- phase has 

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,250
separate panels for each of the features of it. So 1 is the 

73
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,254
current, that's this one in the middle. this is the User Stories 

74
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,257
people are working on, it's a little hard ... it's very hard to 

75
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,259
see but it's the little blue things are the number of points for 

76
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:27,262
each of these stories that are being worked on. The other panels 

77
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,267
there are ... there's the backlog panel which isn't shown, 

78
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,270
there's an icebox which are User Stories that have been sitting 

79
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,272
around, cold storage for a long time in case you get a back log. 

80
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,276
And there's that things that are actually done, you actually 

81
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,278
finished something, you can put them there. It shows the ... and 

82
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,282
this team is ... this number right here in the corner is what 

83
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,285
the velocity is for this team, so it's 10 points per iteration 

84
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,289
that's being used. So this thing is really easy to us and I 

85
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,293
think everybody who's tried it in the classes says has started 

86
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,297
using it. And 1 of the ideas in here is within each of these 

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,300
windows, these are in priority order, and what Pivotal Tracker 

88
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,304
will actually do is take things out of your backlog since it 

89
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,307
assumes it's in automatic order and as you finish the thing it 

90
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:15,309
will pop in the next User Story that you're supposed to work on 

91
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:20,315
because it's prioritized order. So that's Pivotal Tracker. I 

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
think I said those things. How do you complete it? I guess I'll 

93
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,324
talk about that. So it's completed [ inaudible 00:05:25] panel 

94
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,328
and then you can even stick in release points, you think about 

95
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,329
stuff or releases, so when all of these User Stories are done 

96
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,332
that's I'll do a new release and you can calculate the time to 

97
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,335
release by points. Something that they added since we started 

98
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,338
this book is with what they call it Epic Panel and what an Epic 

99
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,341
Panel is, is you put together a bunch of User Stories that are 

100
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,345
related because together they find some important feature that 

101
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,349
they might want. So they're independent of the backlog, so you 

102
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,352
might also use Epics. What are the roles? So it's not up to the 

103
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,356
developer to decide when it's done. You could imagine ... that 

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,360
looks good enough to me, hit the botton. So they borrow from the 

105
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,364
Scrum ideas of a product owner so in the Scrum, 1 of your team 

106
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,368
members if the Scrum master and 1 of them is the product owner, 

107
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,371
so the idea is before you can sign off, you say I think it's 

108
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,374
done, the product owner takes a look at it and then if the 

109
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:23,378
product owner thinks representing the perspective of the owner 

110
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,383
thinks the story is done marks done, if not it rejects it and 

111
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,387
sorry, it's not ready to go, here are the reasons you have to go 

112
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,389
back and work on it. So it's not just up to the developer to do 

113
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:37,392
them. Pivotal Tracker kind of like there's spikes and things 

114
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,397
like that. They have 2 different things, features or User 

115
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,399
Stories that provide business value to the customer. So let's 

116
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:49,403
add, you have to get the consent, let's add the consent box on 

117
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,409
the check out page so that you agree to that. So there's points 

118
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,411
that's associated with it, values the customers, those are 

119
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,414
features. There's also things called Chores which you can keep 

120
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,416
track which is work for the team to do. So they are necessary 

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,420
but they don't provide any obvious value to customer like find 

122
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,424
out why the test suite is low. Okay. So there's no point 

123
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,427
associated with that. Now to do this work as a team, you're 

124
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,432
going to need besides tracking what's going on some space to 

125
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,435
work and let me just talk about it here. So Pivotal Tracker does 

126
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,439
allow you to attach documents so you use your stories, kind of 

127
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,442
documents associated with them. You may know there's a wiki 

128
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,445
associated with your [ inaudible 00:07:25], that's another place 

129
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,447
for your team to work. We use Google Documents a lot, teams of 

130
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:36,451
people developing either drawing or presentations, spreadsheets, 

131
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,456
all that stuff, it's easy for the group to work on them and then 

132
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,459
if you want to use chat rooms, open source 1 is called Camp Fire 

133
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,463
where you can have [ inaudible 00:07:44] for your team. So these 

134
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,466
things your team might want ti work on now that you're going to 

135
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,469
start working with customers.
