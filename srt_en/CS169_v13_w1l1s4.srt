1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So we're gonna try the three by five cards here alright so the 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,004
actual model the way it works see if people get a variety of 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,008
answers this time is if we disagree then we'll have to talk 

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:16,012
about yourselves and vote again as a pair So what is the weakest 

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,016
argument these are all arguments for Google app's popularity is 

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,019
which of these four you think is the weakest so don't lose data 

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,023
in gmail cooperating group and drive or you know Google 

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:32,027
documents a large changing dataset YouTube or no field upgrade 

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,032
when you improve the app so I want you think about a few seconds 

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,035
and then pick a card hold up and I'll see if there's 

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,039
disagreements here okay ready set okay this where you vote on 

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,044
your own pick everybody has a card everybody must have a card 

13
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,047
the colors. I see a wide variety of colors so then what we do 

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,051
next is talk to the person next to you and if you agree that's 

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,056
easy if you disagree talk it over and try to convince other with 

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,060
red one and then you the pair you vote on a single card   okay 

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:09,064
let's let's trying trying vote so there should be either both of 

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,069
you hold the same card or one hold hands with the card or 

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:18,073
something like that ready set vote Uh bunch lots of oranges yeah 

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,078
pretty much all the colors so this one is there probably be more 

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,082
definite this is a matter of of opinion so don't lose data gmail 

22
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,086
I think that's a pretty good reason cooperating groups that's 

23
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,089
our group on we go to Google docs that's because a bunch of us 

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,092
are gonna work on it together a large changing dataset You Tube 

25
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:41,096
is one exabyte video exabyte I think that's about a million 

26
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,101
terabytes right that's amazing no field upgrade when improve the 

27
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,104
app well that is the benefit of search but at least to my taste 

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,108
probably the main reason for search is that they have petabytes 

29
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
of information that they collected web everywhere and probably 

30
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
that's the stronger reason to search but but this is this one is 

31
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,117
really kind of argue you know you can argue about what's the 

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,121
right answer here so that it's not a single answer
