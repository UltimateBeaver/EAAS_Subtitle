1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So let's try another one of these poles here. So which 

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,006
statements are which statement is not true about service 

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,010
oriented architecture. Service oriented architecture does not 

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,013
affect performance. Silo'd systems are likely completely down on 

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,017
a failure so service oriented architecture must handle partial 

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,020
failures. Service oriented architecture improves developer 

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,023
productivity primary through use. And no service oriented 

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,027
architecture service can name or access another service's data; 

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,030
it can only make requests for data through an external A.P.I. 

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:44,034
Alright. So look for couple seconds and then vote.   Okay now. 

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,044
Alright, everybody's orange yeah yeah that's right that's the 

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,047
downside of service oriented architecture effects performance. 

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,050
Two down side effects performance some but computers are so 

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,054
fast, software productivity can't be slowed. But, the fact that 

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
they could have partial failures probably a bigger problem that 

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,060
mounting system if it crashes, it's often air. This one pieces 

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,065
of it cannot work so customers might complain that this isn't 

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,068
even working right you can't and tell because some service works 

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,070
and some of it best
