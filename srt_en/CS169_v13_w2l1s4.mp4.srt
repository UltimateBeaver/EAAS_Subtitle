1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, let's do another [ fear question. A big

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,004
difference . .. which statement is true? A big different between 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,008
agile and plan and document is that agile does not use 

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,011
requirements . A big different between agile and plan and 

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,013
document is measuring progress against a plan. You can build 

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,017
softwares and service apps using agile but not with plan and 

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,020
document . A big different between agile and plan and document 

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:28,023
is building prototypes and interacting with customers during the 

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:34,028
process . Why don't you take a few seconds here . Ready, set , 

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,034
vote. How many  people should have . .. how many people have 

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,038
cards? That one we could talk over . Let's talk that one over. I 

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:48,041
think blue and green are the two ones . Let's talk this over for 

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
a minute then we'll vote together.  That's a minute,  let's 

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,051
vote again . Let's see if . .. ready , set, vote . Alright, I 

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
think it's greener . Let's see. A big different between agile 

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,060
and plan and document is agile does not use requirements . 

17
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,063
There's this thing called user stories . Those are basically 

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,067
requirements. It's an informal requirement to [ inquirement 

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,070
00:01:06] , that's not the right answer. You can build saas 

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:17,072
applicants using agile but not with plan and document. No, you 

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,077
could do saas with plan and document . It changes frequently, it 

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,079
might be expensive but you could do it that way. These are the 

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,083
last two . A big different between Agile and plan and document 

24
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,087
is building prototypes and interacting with customers during the 

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,090
process. No , that happens in spiral, right ? Spiral and [rap 

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,091
00:01:28 ] does meet with them they just meet with them a lot 

27
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,095
less frequently. The difference is the speed of interaction. The 

28
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,097
right answer here is the second one , the green one. A big 

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,101
different between agile and plan and document is measuring 

30
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,104
progress against a plan . There's really not a plan in Agile 

31
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:47,107
that you are measuring progress against. You're interacting with 

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,107
the customer and making progress that way.
