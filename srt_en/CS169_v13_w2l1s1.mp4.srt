1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Big ideas about how to develop software and ways to build 

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,008
software and your jumped into ruby,  this new exciting programming 

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:19,012
language or not you but you need a lot of us well traditionally 

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,019
the first thing that we had developing software we call it plan and 

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:30,023
document process and so remember from the last couple of 

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,030
segments that there was this if that you thinking by building 

7
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,034
software is the greatest job in the world except you know you could

8
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:42,037
be made fun by your friends and neighbours. So about you know twenty 

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,042
years building software did he ask the question can we make it as 

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,046
predictable as building a bridge, a civil engineering facility why can't software 

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,049
development as dependable as  civil engineering cost and schedule 

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:58,053
{paul}. And so what to do. So with its software is only like six 

13
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:03,058
years old so somebody had to invente how to do that. And this idea 

14
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,063
bring engineering discipline to to software was coined in 

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:13,066
nineteen sixty nine and yeah it was frustrating to people to start 

16
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,073
having disasters. So we call plan and document collectively will be 

17
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:23,077
three examples of those is before anybody starts writing code make 

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,083
a plan that's the way you build a bridge so that's way you should do software. 

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:31,086
You write detailed documentation for all phases of the plan 

20
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,091
a and then you measure progress against the plan is so you start 

21
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,094
building software and then if you gonna have to make changes in 

22
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,097
the project should be making changes in the plan and the 

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,100
documentation. So the first example of this has become known as 

24
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,104
the waterfall process which came out right in software 

25
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,108
engineering was first going. And the idea was to have five 

26
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,112
explicit phases and so rather than calling it a software 

27
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,116
development process also called a lifecycle. So this waterfall 

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,120
software development processor life cycle. First is to write 

29
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:09,124
requirements down in into a specification, do the analysis and 

30
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,129
write specification second faces architectural design the third 

31
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,133
phase is building integrating the pieces together, then you 

32
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,137
verify it, remember verification is making sure it does spec says and 

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,142
finally you move into operations and maintenance phase. So this is the 

34
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,145
classic phase. And you complete one phase before you go the next 

35
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,149
one and the idea was that they found is that the earlier you found a bug 

36
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,152
you find a bug in architecture phase it's a lot cheaper than you find it  

37
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,156
in the verification phase. And because the last of long time, years 

38
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,161
for building software projects the extensive documentation they're 

39
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,164
apart so when you employees come the end they can get up to speed so 

40
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:53,168
it is that's story. So that was first software development process 

41
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,173
of life cycle how well doesn't work. Well here's the something 

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,177
that somebody posted anonymously and the uses exclaimed with a 

43
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,181
laugh and a taunt. It's just what we ask for but not what we 

44
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,185
want. Alright? So typically what happens when you dealing with customers 

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,189
they don't quite know what they want. And when you build 

46
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,192
something it starts to work they realise that's not what 

47
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,195
we want, I don't know what we want but that's not it. That's idea right. So that happen in the waterfall

48
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,199
you take years you get there you show it to the customer they change their 

49
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:30,203
mind. Another one is from Fred brooks. And his phrase is a throw 

50
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,210
the first implementation away you will anyhow. So Fread Brooks one my 

51
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,214
personal heroes and we'll call him a couple of times but he won 

52
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:42,217
the Nobel prize computer science. And is author of the famous

53
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,222
book in software engineering called mythical manmonth and basically what happens 

54
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,226
is developers mostly of the first one then I get an idea has 

55
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,230
been implemented and if you had the way they do begin better so 

56
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,233
so kind of this is what the problem soft whatever life cycle is 

57
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,237
they would build software customers didn't like and then after they 

58
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,241
build it they realise the right way to do it that inspire the next of 

59
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,246
life cycle called spiral. And what's trying to combine is the 

60
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,250
features of waterfall is a lot of planning and documentation 

61
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:19,254
with building prototypes and iterations and prototypes. So what 

62
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:24,259
you do is evolve a document over time 

63
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,264
every time you do a iteration so here let's look at this drawing 

64
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,268
out these so these four quadrants as what you go around building 

65
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,271
startup down here with the determine the objectives and 

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,274
constraints then the next step is you evaluate a bunch of 

67
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:43,278
alternatives and identify any risk to the project and figure out 

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:48,283
result then the next phase is you developing verified prototype 

69
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,288
do the verification of the prototype. You know this is a portion of what you do and 

70
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,291
you show it to the customers. And then you get feedback and then next 

71
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,295
iteration so we met fan right here and then you again again 

72
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:06,299
again in this final prototype then is is the product which so 

73
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,306
we'll see if this works. So what's the good the bad parts are 

74
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,310
the the good iterations of a customer it's less likely when you 

75
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,315
build this thing that the customers are gonna change the mind. 

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,318
So they'll see it as ball that's a good thing reduce the cancer 

77
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,321
misunderstanding risk management that kinda come from the 

78
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,324
business school you identify the recent dance to try and avoid 

79
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,327
them that's part of this life cycle. It's pretty easy to 

80
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,330
monitor or it's easier to monitor the project. The waterfall was supposed to be 

81
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,333
separate phases you're going around to see where you are in the 

82
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:42,336
second or third and your schedule and cost projections get more 

83
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,342
realistic overtime you're more familiar with the customers 

84
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,345
seated get idea because if yeah but that things are these 

85
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,349
iterations a pretty long they could be half a year to two years 

86
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,352
long which is plenty of time for customers change your mind if 

87
00:05:55,355 --> 00:06:00,355
it takes a year between iterations lots of documentation for 

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
every iteration every iteration gotta right set of documentation 

89
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,363
that these rules that you following abilities those four phases 

90
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,367
where you're not supposed to do one of the other faces until you 

91
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,369
get to the next phase the temptation is gonna skip steps. So 

92
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,372
it's part product stick to it because of all the documentation 

93
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:21,376
in the building of prototypes it's pretty expensive. And it's it 

94
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,381
it proved to be hard to me budget schedule purpose. So that was so 

95
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:31,386
waterfall spiral. The third example in this is another fifteen 

96
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,391
years later fifteen years after a spiral and thirty years after waterfall 

97
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,395
is what's called the rational unified process. It's not rational 

98
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,399
cause it's the others rational rationals name that company 

99
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,402
came up with some rational unified process. So what you can see 

100
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,406
in this design here these faces across the top. And then they 

101
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,410
have what they called engineering requirements you'll unique 

102
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,412
across the bottom so I'll come back to the slide show you again

103
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,416
and you can have multiple iterations within one of these phases. So there're two 

104
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,419
elaboration for construction and sort of these days too the 

105
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,424
first phase call section you come up the business case for the 

106
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,427
software this RUP models more closely tied to business processes. 

107
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,432
So what's the business case for building it why should we make this investment because that's 

108
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,435
what would be return in this investment. This is the time you set the 

109
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,438
schedule and the budget for the project and you do this risk 

110
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:27,442
assessment of things so that white either cost budget or 

111
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,447
schedules that restraint try and evaluate the second phase 

112
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,451
collaboration word you develop use cases will talk about these 

113
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,455
pieces are later it's kind of ways the software you use you 

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,458
develop the architecture of the software and later we'll talk 

115
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,461
about the importance of architectural building software works. 

116
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,464
And you build the first basic prototype that's phase two. Phase three 

117
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,468
construction were you the coding and you testing for the 

118
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,471
product and you actually the first product release in the last 

119
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,475
phase call transition was where you move to the real environment 

120
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,479
where the software running and you get customers sign off on 

121
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:07,482
customer acceptance. So that's the four phases of right the 

122
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,487
engineering disciplines that you'll need in varies over the 

123
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,489
lifetime of it is business modelling this is make the business 

124
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,492
case doing requirements analysis design implementation just 

125
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,496
fine. So let's go back to see how this all together in the 

126
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,500
slides. So here the requirements we see the business modelling 

127
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,504
plays a bigger role in the business in inception phase in the 

128
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,508
beginning collaborations can advise off deployment is kind of the opposite

129
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,512
profile what happens at the end very last construction 

130
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,517
iterations in the beginning of in the transition phase you can 

131
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:46,521
actually planet testing happens periodically releases a lot of 

132
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,526
more different implementations so that yours team has these 

133
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,529
skills you need more of them different skills later. So what's 

134
00:08:54,534 --> 00:09:04,534
the what's the good and the bad of the RUP model? okay a the 

135 
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,544
drilling the business processes because you have you building 

136
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,546
software the active business case for them that's more closely 

137
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:14,549
tied in others lots of tools rational was a company that was 

138
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,554
making tools for sales call computer aided software engineering 

139
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,557
case tools these are very expensive tens of thousands of 

140
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,560
dollars. And idea but also to get an idea the tools support 

141
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,565
rationally improvement project over time a there this is you 

142
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,570
know it's tens of thousands of dollars tools is open source 

143
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,573
version so unless you pay rational idea more money you can't use 

144
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,576
the tools. There's a lot of ways to tailor it you know how many 

145
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,580
phases{ hydrogens }but also you may not result tools intensity get 

146
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,584
only for big projects causes you know expensive one that it's 

147
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,588
automatically decide how one iteration within of the phases the 

148
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,592
so it's the manager's experience in fact what's true about all of these 

149
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:01,595
projects is they expect a strong project manager that this 

150
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,601
person writes the contract to that's going to win the project 

151
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:10,605
from a customer here she recruits people new hires are people 

152
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,610
from within the company this is the boss of your she's 

153
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,614
evaluating the performance of all programmers limiting it that 

154
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,617
which affect the sorry. And here she's responsible for 

155
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,621
estimating the cost maintaining the schedule again one of the we have 

156
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,624
and how to over come risks that's all managers. And they have to 

157
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,628
document all this in the management plan and pretty much the 

158
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:37,632
boss gets credited if it's success gets blamed if it's a over budget what 

159
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,637
these teams plan and document methods tend to get bigger primarily 

160
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,642
through expansion in another famous thing this thing Fred Brooks is 

161
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,646
from the mythical man month is adding manpower to late project 

162
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,649
makes later. So this is something he observed right over behind 

163
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,653
what really we're gonna people that's gonna make words what said 

164
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,656
as we bring the people or it takes time for you people learn the 

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,660
project also the other. So it takes awhile useful and and 

166
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,664
communication goes up as number people in the project. So the 

167
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,667
bigger the project of the more times than communicating less 

168
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,671
time there is work. So you can scale up to bigger groups at the 

169
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,674
{Kennedy not too big so that it have not	 to miss time mutation 

170
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,678
and then you still higher. }
