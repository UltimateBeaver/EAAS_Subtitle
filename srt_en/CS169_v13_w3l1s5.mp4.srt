00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now that we know how testing works in a modern software 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,004
development environment, we're going to take a look at the tool 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,007
called RSpec that we're going to be using for most of our 

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,009
testing in this course. In introducing it, I'm going to 

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:16,012
introduce an acronym to help you remember some of the principles 

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,016
that go along with writing tests. Unit tests should be FIRST. 

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,020
You can remember by the acronym FIRST these desirable properties 

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,023
when you're writing unit tests. They should be fast. They should 

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,025
be independent. They should be repeatable. They should be self- 

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,029
checking, and they should be timely. Briefly, what does each one 

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,033
of these mean and why do we care about it? Fast just means that 

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,037
the test don't take very long to run. As we're going to see, a 

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
typical application even a simple one is going to have hundreds 

14
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,043
or thousands of test cases, so if the test took a long time to 

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,046
run, it would disrupt your flow as you're moving between running 

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,049
a test, writing a test, and writing the code. Independent means 

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,053
that you can run any subset of the test, and expect them to work 

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,056
in isolation. In other words, there is no dependencies on the 

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,058
order in which different tests run. Again this is because in a 

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,062
larger application even when the tests are running fast, it may 

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,065
be too costly to run the entire test suite every time you make a 

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,068
change. Having independent tests means that you can only run 

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,071
that subset of tests that might be affected by your most recent 

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
code changes. Repeatable means that the test will do the same 

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,077
thing every time you run them. Now, this might seem obvious, but 

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
when we do the self- check question for this lecture, we'll look 

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,083
at some scenarios where it's not so clear if you can make a test 

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,086
repeatable when they're trying to test a code that is inherently 

29
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:33,088
none- deterministic such as if you're flipping a coin. Self- 

30
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,093
checking means that no human being should have to examine the 

31
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,095
output of the test in order to figure out whether they passed or 

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,098
not, so the test should have enough information that after it's 

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,101
finished executing, it knows whether the right thing happened. 

34
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,104
We care about this for the same reason we care about any type of 

35
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,107
automation. When we automate our test suites being ran and the 

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,110
results being collected, it allows us to have a repeatable task 

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
that we can always have running in the background. In fact, 

38
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,117
that's what we're going to argue for in this lecture segment, so 

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,120
repeatable just means that the same thing happens every time you 

40
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,122
run them. Self- checking, they know whether they passed or not. 

41
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,126
Lastly, timely means that the test were written pretty close in 

42
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,129
time to the code that's going to be tested. We've said before 

43
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,133
that we're going to do Test- driven development or TDD. That 

44
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,136
means in most cases we're going to be writing the test before we 

45
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,138
write the code. Later on on the course, we're going to teach you 

46
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,141
how to do that, but for the time being, for the first couple of 

47
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,144
homeworks, we have provided the test cases for you. We're going 

48
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:33,147
to illustrate now how RSpec works to help us run those cases. 

49
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,153
RSpec is a domain- specific language for testing, and a domain- 

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,157
specific language or DSL means that it's specialized that doing 

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
some narrow set of tasks at the expense of generality or at the 

52
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,164
expense of other tasks. You've already seen some examples of 

53
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,166
this. For example, regular expressions are a DSL for expressing 

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,170
patterns that might match different kinds of strengths. If 

55
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,173
you're familiar with data- based programming, SQL, the 

56
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,175
Structured Query Language is a domain- specific language for 

57
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,178
making data- based queries. A difference with RSpec is that it's 

58
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,182
a domain- specific language embedded in Ruby. That is to say 

59
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,186
that every RSpec program is actually a valid Ruby code, and it 

60
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,189
takes advantage of Ruby features like a poetry mode to make it 

61
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:17,191
more readable. What does this look like? Looking at this first 

62
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,197
set of tests, we're describing a class called dessert, what 

63
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,201
you're going to be asked to create as part of the next homework. 

64
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,204
The first blog of tests is about a particular kind of dessert or 

65
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,206
a cake, so what we're saying is the subject of our test is a new 

66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,210
dessert which we're specifying to be a cake with 400 calories. 

67
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,214
Once we've created that new object instance, these very simple 

68
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,218
tests consist of looking at various attributes, and make sure 

69
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,221
that their values are what we expect based on the constructor. 

70
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,224
We also have an apple which should be delicious and should be 

71
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,228
healthy. As we get farther into the class, we'll teach you how 

72
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,231
to interpret these specs in more detail, but for now, note that 

73
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,234
things like beetle issues and be healthy use method- missing to 

74
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,238
actually call method as delicious question mark and healthy 

75
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,241
question mark in your class. As you read the homework 

76
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,243
assignment, it will become clear that you're supposed to write 

77
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,245
these methods to give information as to whether the dessert is 

78
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:13,248
healthy or not. RSpec tests are called specs or examples. Each 

79
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,253
spec or example tests one behavior, and one way to run the test 

80
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,257
file is to run the RSpec command against the particular 

81
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,260
filename, like the file that we just saw. What you'll see is 

82
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,264
that you get error messages printed out in red for the test that 

83
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,266
fail. The test that passed will be shown in green. Test that 

84
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,270
have not yet been implemented or a so called pending test will 

85
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,273
be shown in yellow. Now, as I said, a large project could have 

86
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,276
thousands of test cases spread across hundreds of files, and 

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,280
running RSpec on each file or even on the whole suite might not 

88
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,283
be very efficient, so instead, we're going to prefer this other 

89
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,286
technique of using autotest, which is a nice tool that not only 

90
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,289
runs all of your RSpec tests but any time you make a change to 

91
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,292
the test code or a change to the app code, autotest will figure 

92
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,295
out which tests need to be re- run. It will automatically do 

93
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,298
that. It's running in the background all the time. Let's take a 

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,300
look at a demonstration of how that might work. I'm going to 

95
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:19,304
skip to the ... Okay, this is basically the contents of the 

96
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:27,319
directory that you guys are going to get for homework one. 

97
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,327
There's about five or six different files full of tests that 

98
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,330
we've created for you guys. I've got one of them up here. It's 

99
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,334
called " Fun with Strings spec". As you'll see, there's a 

100
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,338
convention that when I follow the name of a filename with 

101
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,341
underscore spec, it means this is specs that go with that class. 

102
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,344
I'm going to go into this directory, and I'm going to run 

103
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:53,347
autotest. If I scroll up through here, you'll see there's a lot 

104
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,353
of yellow messages, all of which are pending. It says, " No 

105
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,356
reason given. They're yellow, but I don't know why they're 

106
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,358
yellow." Well, the reason is that in the test files that we 

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,360
supplied to you guys initially, all of the blocks of tests are 

108
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,365
marked pending true, which means " don't even try to run these 

109
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,369
tests because the code is not there yet." Now, supposed I delete 

110
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,373
pending true for one segment of these tests, so you can see 

111
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,377
there's three different tests here. It should work for simple 

112
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,379
strings. It should be case- insensitive. It should ignore none- 

113
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,382
word characters. I'm now going to save this file, and without me 

114
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:30,384
doing anything, here we go, ready? Say file. Oh! It woke up. Now 

115
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,390
it says, " Three failing examples," and indeed the three 

116
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,393
examples that I just looked at at lines five, nine and 12, it's 

117
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,395
now trying to run them, and re- divider should be up [ inaudible 

118
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,398
00:06:38] in their own but it's not, so the meat of the homework 

119
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,402
assignment id to write the code that does this, but what you 

120
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,404
just saw is I changed something in the test file. Autotest 

121
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,408
immediately figured out what I changed, and tried to rerun only 

122
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,410
those tests. If I had been changing my code file, autotest would 

123
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,415
figure out which tests have used that code file in the past so 

124
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,418
that it could run the test against my updated code, so it just 

125
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,421
run autotest in the background, and as you modify the code in 

126
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,423
test files, you'll start to see these lines go green one at a 

127
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,426
time as you backfill the code necessary for the test to pass.
