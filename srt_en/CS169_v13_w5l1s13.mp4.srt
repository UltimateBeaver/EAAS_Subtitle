00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
ï»¿All right. With that, let's ask some questions before [ our 

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:09,003
trend in 00:00:03] demo. Again, this might not be too hard, 

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,009
which is true. Usually, you complete Behavior Driven Design 

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,012
phase with Cucumber before starting the Test Driven Development 

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:20,015
phase with RSpec. Usually you code the sad path first. A sad 

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,020
path can pass without having code written needed to make a happy 

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:36,024
path pass. None of the above is true. Ready, set, vote. Which is 

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:42,036
true? I think everybody got this one right. Usually, you 

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,042
complete BDD a separate design phase. No, it's either to back 

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,046
and forth in BDD and TDD. Usually you code the sad path first. 

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,049
Usually, you code the happy path first. You like to see it 

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,051
working, but we just got this pedagogic problem and we're going 

13
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,055
to do this example, so yes. Okay.
