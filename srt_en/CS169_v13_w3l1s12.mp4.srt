00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's understand the answers to this self- check question. 

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,002
What's going on here? We want to select only the word " bar" for 

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,005
styling and the question is which of these is going to do it? 

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:11,007
Well, let's look at them each in turn. What about span. myClass? 

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,011
That means the element tag has to match span and the C is what 

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,015
the class attribute has to be myClass. That would work. Here's a 

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
span and it has the correct class value. It selects only the 

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,022
word " bar". Notice that even though the outer paragraph, the P 

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,025
also has myClass. It doesn't match, because our role 

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:32,028
specifically says it has to be a span tag. This one is okay. 

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,032
What about the second one? This is an example of descended 

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:39,034
navigation. We're saying, we want to match a element that has 

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,039
the class myClass but only if that element is nested inside of a 

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:48,042
P element. Again, here is an element that matches class myClass. 

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
It's nested inside of a P element. The fact that the P element 

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,051
also happens to have class myClass is irrelevant in this case. 

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,055
The second one also works, because it does not select the outer 

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,058
element. It selects the innermost one that matches the whole 

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,060
rule. Whatever the third one. The third one says we're looking 

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,064
for a span element, but only if it's inside an element that has 

21
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,068
the CSS class myClass. Well, here's a span element and it is 

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:17,072
indeed inside of a CSS element that has the class myClass and 

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,077
just as in the previous rule, the fact that the span element 

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
itself also has that class, that's irrelevant for the purposes 

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,083
of matching this rule, right? The rule just says a span no 

26
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,086
matter what as long as it's inside of something that matches 

27
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,089
myClass. In this case, all three of these are valid ways to 

28
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,093
select only the word " bar" for applying visual styles.
