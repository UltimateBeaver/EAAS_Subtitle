00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to software engineering this is a really it's I'm 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,004
excited to be talking about this when I was a student what was 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,007
called software engineering just didn't make any sense you know 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,010
what other people trying to figure out how to build software and 

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,013
advice they had you couldn't possibly take advantage of this 

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,016
course what's exciting is now we can the software has been 

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,019
changed so it 's easier to do. So why are you all here maybe not 

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,023
why are you all here but what a great taste you have in courses 

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,027
I think that so so last year somebody get a ranking of all the 

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,031
jobs in the united states by job title this company. So I I 

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,034
thought I'd go through it in reverse order here like a top ten 

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:42,037
list you know so somebody you are a kid growing up I think this 

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,042
is a cool job and so let me go go backwards looks like maybe you 

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,045
want to be a lumberjack that's absolutely the worst job so how 

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:54,049
it is how do they picked it was based on salary stress levels 

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,054
hiring outlook physical demands of work environments a 

17
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:01,056
lumberjack work environment not so great but lumberjack is only 

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,061
four things worse than newspaper reporter yeah so so for your 

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,065
friends in journalism you might you know check. Maybe they'd 

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,069
like lumberjack and and then you're growing up you know I wanna 

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,073
be a firefighter or maybe a flight attendant or a police officer 

22
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,077
or high school teacher fashion designer pilot those are all on 

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,081
the bottom half of the one hundred list okay now maybe a little 

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,086
bit later in school you thought you know I'd like to have a 

25
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,089
challenge job you know all good lifestyle today suppose you said 

26
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,093
attorney well that's a little better that's in the top half but 

27
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,097
towards the bottom now we 're in the ECS department how's how 

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:52,100
many of you are electrical engineers right that's next Yeah it 

29
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,112
seems like engineering seems pretty good so mechanical still the 

30
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,115
but you know if you're not the top quarter yet accountants you 

31
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,118
know that's in the top quarter finally how about a doctor you 

32
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:07,122
can lots of kids wanna be a doctor right that's barely there or 

33
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:12,127
a nurse in terms of the kind the best engineering position is 

34
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,132
civil engineering at least on the Berkeley campus is actually 

35
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,134
another one we don't have petroleum engineering that's a pretty 

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,136
good job right now. But the number one job in the united states 

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:29,140
is software engineer right sorry. So that's very it's cool that 

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,149
we are teaching things you know that people can have the best 

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:36,151
job in the united states but if it's such the best job why do we 

40
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,156
screw up at it so much okay that's the thing that's fascinating 

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,160
or yeah yeah are frustrating to having been in the field a long 

42
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,163
time and you can you can follow this on wikipedia. but there's a 

43
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,166
few of them if you are in a software engineering community you 

44
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,169
know the cliche all you have to do is mention the word video 

45
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,172
yeah I I know about that one So you need to know if you don't 

46
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,174
know about that so one of the first scary ones is the Therac 

47
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,178
lethal radiation overdose So this is nineteen eighty five and 

48
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,181
the predecessor machine had hard[unclear] inner locks to make 

49
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:08,184
sure you didn't give somebody too much radiation that machine 

50
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,188
the Thrac twenty five took away the hard? locks the software was 

51
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,192
already working under And its predecessor that uses the same 

52
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,195
software made some changes to it you moved the software forward 

53
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,198
there was a bug that rarely occurred six people would burn to 

54
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,201
creation and three of those died So a software for bug kill 

55
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,205
people that was eye opening the Mars climate orbiter 

56
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,209
disintegration. So the ground computer used imperial units and 

57
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,214
the satellite computer used metric units they use different 

58
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,218
units and so when the orbiter came its time went the wrong angle 

59
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,221
and burned up so psht three hundred million dollars the thing 

60
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,225
that amazes me is that the F. B. I. partial file case. So what 

61
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,228
happened that for five years they tried to build a virtual file 

62
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,230
case to give F. B. I. agents the ability to have things at their 

63
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,234
fingertips they gave it was so bad they they didn't like fix it 

64
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,236
they said just okay we'll just throw it all away a hundred 70 

65
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,239
million dollars. But the most spectacular software bug the Arian 

66
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:10,244
five so the aryan five annals of history that one momentarily 

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,250
yeah so the Aryan four again it worked fine but the Aryan five 

68
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:22,257
ran faster than the aryan four so they they take the aryan four 

69
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:27,262
software for five to save space they stored numbers in sixteen 

70
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,267
bit integers but they calculated sixty four bit floating point 

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,270
numbers the Aryan five can fly faster than the Aryan four so the 

72
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:44,275
number was bigger and so what happens is what it's going oh you 

73
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:58,284
can't hear it right okay software there goes three hundred 

74
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,298
twenty five million dollars of satellites right there okay so 

75
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,302
this you know there's this IEEE software or ItripleE spectrum 

76
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,306
has a whole a wall of shame that I think it's seventeen billion 

77
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:17,310
dollars so why it is such a great job you know why is it why's 

78
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,317
it so bad so there's this wall of shame how do you avoid that 

79
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,321
right so that we've been developing software for sixty years. 

80
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,324
And what we're gonna do in this classes is go over all the 

81
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,328
things that you can oh there's been a lot of [unclear] try but 

82
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,332
we're gonna go over them in this class but there's one we're 

83
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,335
going emphasize really we're going to emphasize the one that's 

84
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,338
got the software why we're saying ten thousand students around 

85
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,341
the world have got certificates from the course last year 

86
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,345
enrollments have grown you know before before computing was 

87
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,347
popular computing was popular teaching evaluations last time was 

88
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,351
really good so what you're gonna do is how do you not end up on 

89
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,354
wikipedia pages something you want to take off your resume right 

90
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,356
you're gonna learn how to do it the right way
