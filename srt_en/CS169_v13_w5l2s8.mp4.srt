1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're voting. We're voting. Okay, let me read the question one 

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,009
more time because never so many have been so wrong for the same 

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:19,012
reason. The method that contacts TMDb to search for a movie? 

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,019
Take a little bit to think about that, in case you voted, say 

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:28,023
red, before. Now that I'm trying to give it away. Let's try 

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:33,028
another vote with my very big hint. What's going on here? I want 

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,033
to see if people are on their toes. I see that the booth has 

8
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:42,037
voted blue. Let's look at the possibilities here. I threw a 

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,042
little bit of a curve ball at you, but it worked apparently. It 

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,046
is true, we are about to embark on coding a controller method. 

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,050
However, I also wanted people to remember in the model to 

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,053
controller paradigm, where does the action occur that has to do 

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
with any interesting computation around the data model? It 

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,060
occurs in the model. Okay? The controller method is going to 

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,063
receive the form submission and it is going to be responsible 

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,066
for making the right thing happen with the model, but the 

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,068
action, ultimately, of figuring out how to get data from 

18
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,071
somewhere else and transform that into data that we can use to 

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
populate our movie model, that is clearly model related logic. 

20
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,077
At the end of the day, it's going to be something in the movie 

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
model that does that and from then on, it should be easier to 

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,083
figure out, you can't call find_in_TMDb on any ... you can't 

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,088
have a specific movie be the recipient of that message because 

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,090
you haven't found the movie yet. You have to go generally find 

25
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,092
the movie and then use the information, so it's going to be a 

26
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,094
class method of movie. I understand that you all have the 

27
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,097
keyword controller in your brains, but the lesson here is 

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,099
sometimes the keyword is not the answer.
