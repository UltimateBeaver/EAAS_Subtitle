1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So or I'm gonna do the lecture today you're gonna see so much of 

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:07,003
Armondo you get tired of seeing him so that Armando you'll see 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,007
him more.So, today what we're going to do in class organisation 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,010
and then jump in and start lecturing uh you'll find out about 

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,013
the book for the course we told you some about it but will try 

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,015
to cover the first six sections of the book today. So first, 

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,019
what's this course about learning software engineering 

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,021
principles understanding challenges opportunities the problems 

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,025
here. And what you're going to do in this class you're going to 

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,029
take build a real application working with real nontechnical 

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,033
customers you're gonna on the server side you going to learn 

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,036
ruby on rails and the client side all these things you've 

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,039
already heard about the javascript. And deploy using cloud 

14
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,043
computing that's a big part class you're gonna be teams probably 

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,046
six a little bit bigger dealing with non-technical customers and 

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,050
things in the past we've done the humane society minority firms, 

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,055
the children's hospital nearby Oakland helping them vacation 

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,059
planning teams are you get started this weeks ago discussion 

19
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:07,062
section the first to is find a team. Your team needs to be in 

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,067
your discussion section I'm gonna show you a quick video what we 

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,070
interviewed the nurses after a little bit example so you think 

22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
vacation scheduling would be easy but not with union rules. All 

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,077
kinds of different rules there we have elaborate pencil and 

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,081
paper method with note books and Berkeley students the alumni 

25
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,084
have this course stepped in and created a wonderful work 

26
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,086
interface let me just hold on see if this is really gonna work 

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,090
Sometimes we met weekly, sometimes it was every two weeks I 

28
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:41,096
never for more twenty minus oh yes It didn't take a lot of time 

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:46,101
for us but trying to convey to them the rules that we have to go 

30
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,106
by know why vacation show them what we did. And we showed them 

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,110
the rules and then gave them a copy of the rules they came back 

32
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:59,114
with ideas that we couldn't have put forward and yeah brought 

33
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,119
into this institution. you gave a lot of feedback on what they 

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:09,123
were doing and then right easily fixed any concerns and it was 

35
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,129
amazing.So, now with this prototype in place is there a point to 

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,133
you person hope things get better? Correct. Yes. So our 

37
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,135
vacations are due February first of each year. And so we start 

38
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:28,139
usually in January. yeah I've got it going to try to make this 

39
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:36,148
an issue okay oh right right right screaming we could start 

40
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,156
using it in other areas of the hospital as well. That's great, 

41
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,158
thank you for working with our students. Hopefully you will have 

42
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,162
similarly satisfied customers and we'll interview them and when 

43
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,165
used them the future version the class. Um so what happened was 

44
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,169
the feedback innocent approach not technical but ninety percent 

45
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,172
of them we gave them a multiple choice being disappointed up to 

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,176
happy thrilled and they check happy with thrilled ninety percent 

47
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,178
hal of them wanted to hire the students them happen one of the 

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,180
hard decisions to keep working on it into thirds assumes 

49
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,183
playtime keep working on even after classes over. And we were 

50
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,186
really you know enthused,Armondo and I at just how well engaged 

51
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,190
people were they with this agile a process to get four 

52
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,194
iterations will do it really got into it in the projects varied 

53
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,197
in size and code but not in the quality they were all very well 

54
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,201
done. So how are we gonna grade this course? There these five 

55
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,205
homeworks that's about a third is gonna add up to a little more 

56
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,207
than a third homeworks two midterms no final this project about 

57
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,211
third grade. And there's some altruism points that's you know 

58
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,214
five percent of all that it depends on your participation 

59
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:42,217
helping others lectures are gonna be up to be Mondays and 

60
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,222
wednesdays from two thirty to four there's our office Armondo is 

61
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,226
right after this mine earlier on Wednesday homework is gonna be 

62
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,229
due right before midnight on Sunday and discussion sections of 

63
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:58,233
thursdays and fridays and we're using piazza this this is a four 

64
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,238
unit class the homepage tells you how the grade is going to be 

65
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,242
broken down. So we're hoping what you do come prepared to 

66
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,245
lecture by doing the Reading before the lecture that's the most 

67
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:12,247
efficient use your time we'll put it in context and are we'll be 

68
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,252
putting it to work. were big believers in this Confucius saying 

69
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:20,255
is I hear and I forget I see I remember I do and I understand 

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,260
you're gonna be doing in understanding your be applying these 

71
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,262
ideas using real tools.The same tools the professional 

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,265
programmers using this and we're gonna do it had to pizza teams 

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,270
that's a nickname for five or six students that you could feed 

74
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,275
with two pizzas. These days maybe you know it even if your 

75
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,279
appetite growing as americans we still find a two pizza team is 

76
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,283
still five or six people and if at the end we're gonna show off 

77
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,287
what you've done one fight all the customers there and this will 

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,290
be on Tuesday December tenth and will even have interested 

79
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,293
people from silicon valley including venture capitalists.A lot 

80
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:01,296
of projects continue after this class the homeworks are gonna be 

81
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:06,301
at the doing understanding done on your own or in pairs and 

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,306
you're gonna do it in the cloud using that extensively in this 

83
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,309
class everything to be done and you need to have it for us since 

84
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,313
the last time we talked last class Berkeley has adopted an honor 

85
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,316
code. And this is the honour code that you as the students have 

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,320
developed as a member of the community I honesty integrity 

87
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,323
respect for others. So basically if you doing something that you 

88
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,327
wouldn't like other students your professors or your parents to 

89
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,330
know probably should stop doing it if you don't want them find 

90
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,333
out about it that's a sign that maybe not doing it and gonna 

91
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,336
help you with your pledge one of the big problems of a software 

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,340
course is getting all the software working that you need to get 

93
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,343
the work done. So or Armando a boldly said virtual machines were 

94
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,346
invented to fix this technology is this problem we're just gonna 

95
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,349
loaded virtual machines got everything you need all the right 

96
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,352
versions you just download go and amazingly enough it actually 

97
00:05:55,355 --> 00:06:00,355
works. Uh you should follow these instructions being rather than 

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
doing some custom installation yourself we strongly recommend 

99
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,363
you don't do that and you're on your own if you do the it 

100
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,366
becomes a discussion section you having any problems on the 

101
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:14,368
virtual machine the GSIs will help Uh, the book for this class 

102
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,374
is something Armando and I've been slaving away at for more than 

103
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,377
maybe a year and a half now, we were we had an alpha edition and 

104
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,381
a beta addition we're now to the second beta addition we're 

105
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,384
almost done. And we're excited that at maybe in part because of 

106
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,387
us a nagging Amazon they announce a couple days ago the ability 

107
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,391
to bundle these together so for thirty three dollars this is 

108
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,394
gonna be the best deal you ever get well there's two things 

109
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,397
about this book it's the best book written by wrestler the music 

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
director but nobody no other pair wrestlers in music directors 

111
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,404
have written is nearly as good a book this and you know we're 

112
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,408
keeping the price down hopeful so that won't be temptations to 

113
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,412
get the book any other way the buying it. And number bundling 

114
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,414
together this'll be the first time that's happened with includes 

115
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:02,417
the right way to do that. So Armando came up with this idea of a 

116
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,422
how can other faculty other campuses take advantage of this 

117
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,425
massive online courses and he came to this idea called the SPOC 

118
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,428
or small private online courses and so you're gonna be kind of 

119
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,431
gonna spot really use that technology forgrading assignments and 

120
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,435
things like that so we want you to sign up on the the the 

121
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,439
Berkeley version of this SPOC will have a a special version of 

122
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,444
kind of MOOC technology for this course and I think it says on 

123
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:32,447
the homepage how to sign up on that so typically you know if you 

124
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,452
need to ask question in the middle lectures okay we'll just try 

125
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,455
and repeat it you know at the end of these segments which about 

126
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,458
every eight or ten minutes or so a bit opportunity ask questions 

127
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:50,462
as well. Okay I think I said that okay yeah you know there's a 

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,470
besides what we've written beside the videos there's a lot 

129
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,474
information about what we gonna lecture in this class because a 

130
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,478
lot of professional people using them. So if you go to this 

131
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,481
website you can find out about things you wanna get started on 

132
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,484
ruby and rails there's tutorials you can get started on to learn 

133
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,487
about C. S. S. get help in all of those things so if you would 

134
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,492
if you find some other things to be useful resources use this 

135
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,495
class go ahead to Piazza and signed that I think I added you all 

136
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,499
everybody's in the class I think I added you all the also if not 

137
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:27,502
you know talk to your GSIs about getting on okay now one of the 

138
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:32,507
things that we've learned over the years is a lot of people 

139
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,512
think you can you know time share your brain and learn something 

140
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,516
what you do three things multitask. We know now that doesn't 

141
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,519
work we actually know the biological reason why it attractive to 

142
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,522
do it apparently evolutionary in our ancestry to get people 

143
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,527
learn things every time you learn a little thing you candles 

144
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,530
squirt dopamine you're in your brain and so you reward for 

145
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,534
learning things. So that was great I think we wouldn't be here 

146
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,536
today to would be seven billion of us you know we haven't been 

147
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,539
encouraged to learn things alas now that we've got a little you 

148
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:10,544
know Tweets and and you know Facebook things. We are addicted to 

149
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,550
this so this story that's a few years old in the New York Times 

150
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,553
talks about a guy who was constantly multitasking all the time 

151
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,556
he wasn't paying attention to his family and he had build a 

152
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,559
software company that he'd asked to sell and use multitasking so 

153
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,565
much he missed the email with somebody offering to buy company 

154
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,568
he missed it for couple of days finally slightly back and 

155
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,571
apologise so heavy multitaskers as regular multicast actually 

156
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,575
have more trouble focusing and shutting out irrelevant 

157
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,578
information scientists say and experience more stress. So all 

158
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,582
this technology that we're help you know responsible for having 

159
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,585
has made it harder for you to learn new things the classroom. So 

160
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,588
we're really hopeful that for the whole eighty minutes in here 

161
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,591
eighty whole minutes of your day that you'll refrain from the 

162
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:00,595
dopamine addiction and not text now will we know that's too much 

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
we know eight units is too much so we'll try about thirty 

164
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:07,602
minutes in we start shaking from the from withdraw love dopamine 

165
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,607
we'll take a look at two minute break. And you can get your 

166
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,609
dopamine shot texting everybody just how brilliant intellectuals 

167
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,612
are in this course and other sure they wish they could be in 

168
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:20,615
here but okay but will please just hold off for you know a few 

169
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,620
minutes of time early in my career I asked some education expert 

170
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,624
well, how should, what is your pace to lectures? What should we 

171
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,627
do and he said this is true about human beings that's true today 

172
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,630
as it was thirty years ago. So if you want this if you goes see 

173
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,634
a talk somewhere you'll see the same kind of behaviour so the 

174
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,638
first twenty minutes human beings can just sit there in the 

175
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,641
chain attention about twenty minutes and they start figit And 

176
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:49,644
basically their attention drops so early on in the course what I 

177
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,649
would do I start off doing now is to all the administrivia stuff 

178
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,652
so that everybody knew that administrivia stuff cold and when 

179
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,656
actually got the technical lectures then you know then they 

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,660
didn't pay attention so what we do is classically we get started 

181
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,663
jumping on the good stuff and then twenty minutes in we do the 

182
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,666
administrivia if a couple minutes and people can you know sh 

183
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,669
around talk to each other and then then we get started again a 

184
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,673
yeah yeah and then we go another twenty twenty five minutes to 

185
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,676
these things are restless we divvy the dopamine break tech 

186
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,678
break. And then we do one last thing and then he said there's 

187
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,682
one thing that everybody gets a visitation the they can say that 

188
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,685
everybody gets excited here in those words are " and in 

189
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:34,688
conclusion" right. So actually if "and in conclusion" means 

190
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,694
don't start packing your bag right just hold on for two more 

191
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,697
minutes Armondo and I are good at stopping the class on time or 

192
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,700
even early. So when I say in conclusion just hold on, listen to 

193
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:49,704
the summary and then back down and go now another thing we could 

194
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,709
start doing I can't remember who has the three by five cards 

195
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,713
okay could you you get recruit volunteers starting as a how many 

196
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,718
of you have done the peer instruction questions like with Dan 

197
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,721
Garcia here people okay so we're gonna do that again about half 

198
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,724
of you have done that so what the idea is a big lecture like 

199
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:12,727
this. You know it can be pretty you know lack of interaction. So 

200
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,732
this person who's a professor in physics at Harvard about 

201
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,735
fifteen years ago came up with this idea that what I would do is 

202
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,739
you know the physics is the getting lost in forest through the 

203
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,742
trees kind of things you know they didn't understand big idea so 

204
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,745
you would do is stop the lecture. So a few times during the 

205
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,748
eighty minutes and ask a relatively simple question. And get 

206
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,752
people to vote on it now of course if you you've ever gonna 

207
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,755
classroom people are going to vote on something you watch you 

208
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:42,757
wanna vote the majority so that wasn't gonna work well so he 

209
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,762
came up with a clicker system and I think the chemistry 

210
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,765
department uses that that means you gotta spend thirty or fifty 

211
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,768
bucks and remember to bring stuff. So I came up with flashcards 

212
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,771
three by five cards "'cause" that we can do pattern recognition. 

213
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,774
So you'll get free cards as part of the bonuses of this class, 

214
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,779
wooh! so these cards and I optimised technology there's two 

215
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:08,783
sided parts you only have to hold onto two three by five cards 

216
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,788
right that's what we have the of remember that those cards and 

217
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,791
its orange on one side and kind of an olive green on the other 

218
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:19,794
another one's red and blue okay let's like we're handing out the 

219
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,799
cards right now. So I don't think I can do the poles. Well we 

220
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,804
could just pretend we could just pretend on the first one and 

221
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,806
you guys could raise your hand this one's pretty. This one's 

222
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,810
pretty easy you have you ever use GitHub? so if you have a card 

223
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,815
holder the orange one if you used GitHub or just raise your hand 

224
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:43,818
alright about maybe what would you say okay how many have you 

225
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:49,823
know how many have not used GitHub use the green one or have not 

226
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,829
alright only a few alright good then the other options ones give 

227
00:13:53,833 --> 00:14:00,833
a in the other option is I've already lost my card right seconds 

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,840
into the semester and you've already lost your card. So let's 

229
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,844
try another that was so much fun, which statement is true if 

230
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,848
you've been paying attention which statement is true about C. S. 

231
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:16,851
one sixty   I can leave early since the midterm Tuesday evening 

232
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,856
right before thanksgiving is optional. I don't have to show up 

233
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,860
for the midterm; how many think that true okay I can leave the 

234
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:28,863
Christmas break early since the poster session on Tuesday twelve 

235
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,868
ten is optional alright that's another choice. Faculty don't 

236
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,871
mind if I text or play on my laptop and finally your project 

237
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,876
team needs to be in the same discussion section okay ready set 

238
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,879
vote. So Armando, notice this. So that people like the people 

239
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,885
who like ten weeks from now I'm sorry I've already booked my 

240
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,888
tickets to go home early for thanksgiving I can't your midterm 

241
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,892
drop the class right now there's people wanna take your place or 

242
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:01,896
I've already I've already I I can't be there for the poster 

243
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,901
session I'm leaving for home on December ninth I can't be there.
