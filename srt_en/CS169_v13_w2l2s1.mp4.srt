1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're going to launch right in today and talk about Ruby as a

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:06,002
modern object- oriented language. If you've come from the Java 

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
world, which many of you have, there's all these concepts that 

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,009
you have to assimilate when you do object- oriented programming. 

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,011
You have to learn about objects, you have to learn about the 

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,013
attributes of objects, and you talk about getters and setters on 

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,016
attributes. You talk about the methods that objects support. 

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,019
Maybe if you've done C++, you know about operator overloading. 

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,023
There's things like interfaces which allow you to add other 

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,025
behaviors to a class. Java also has these primitive types like 

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,029
integers. You have to box and unbox them in order to do certain 

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,032
things to them. At some point, you probably found yourself 

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,035
asking whether there isn't a smaller set of mechanisms that 

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,038
supports the things you're trying to do when you're using all 

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,041
these different mechanisms in a language like Java or C++. 

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,044
Ruby's dramatic simplification of how to deal with this is to 

17
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,047
say everything is an object, everything. The only way you get 

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,050
stuff done is by calling methods on objects. What does this mean 

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,053
concretely? First of all, even the lowly integer is a true 

20
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
object. That means that you can do things like call methods, 

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,060
like days, on actual integers; three days ago will tell you how 

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,065
many seconds it's been since three days ago. Now, in raw Ruby, 

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,068
this won't work. It will work in Rails. I'll get back to why 

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,070
that happens. To give you a sense, I can also say 50 dot 

25
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
methods. I’ m asking the integer 50, " What methods do you 

26
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,077
respond to? What things do you know how to do?" In fact I can, 

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,081
explicitly in Ruby, talk about responding to, I can ask an 

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,085
object directly, “ What methods do you respond to?” by using 

29
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,088
this built- in respond to method. See how good I am at drawing? 

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,092
I'm pretty good, huh? Yeah. In fact, all of these really can be 

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,096
thought of as syntactic sugar around a single construct which is 

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,098
the send method. It's a language primitive. That's the one that 

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,101
says, “ Take the following method call and send it to the 

34
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,104
object.” We say that the object is the receiver in that case. 

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,108
The only thing Ruby cares about is whether the object you're 

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,110
sending a message to knows how to respond to that message. For 

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,114
example, if I say one plus two, what I'm really doing is saying 

38
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,118
shorthand for sending to the receiver the object one, the plus 

39
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,122
message, with an additional argument of two. That's really 

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,124
what's going on internally at the language level. Plus is really 

41
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,128
just another method and it's another that takes one argument 

42
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,131
which is the thing to add to its receiver. Similarly, if I 

43
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,134
dereference an array with square brackets, really I'm sending 

44
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,137
the square bracket dereference method to the target array, and 

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,142
I'm passing another argument which is what the sub- script is 

46
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,144
that I want to get. We can do other examples like when we do 

47
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,147
array assignment, " What's going on here?" Believe it or not, 

48
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,150
this is a method call. There's a method call that means assign 

49
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,154
to an array and, this time, we need two arguments – which sub- 

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,157
script to assign and what the new value ought to be at that 

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
place. The important thing here is that there's actually a 

52
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,162
method to find on arrays, called bracket equals, and, when you 

53
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,166
say, my array sub three equals foo, it's really just a 

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,170
shorthand. Syntactic sugar for calling the bracket equals method 

55
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,173
with those two arguments. This is a dramatically simplifying 

56
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,176
thing that you … it takes a little bit of getting used to but 

57
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,178
bear with me, for just a bit , as I work through a few more 

58
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,181
examples. When I do a comparison, again, what am I doing? I'm 

59
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,185
sending the target a message of double equals with another 

60
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,189
argument of the thing to compare it to and, when I call up 

61
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,192
regular old function, I'm sending to self which is the implicit 

62
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,196
receiver. Right, if you don't see anything before the dot, it 

63
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,199
means whatever the value of self is, and we'll have a lot more 

64
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,201
to say about that when we talk about object orientation. We're 

65
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,204
sending self the name of a method , my func, and one argument 

66
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,208
that's expected by that method. The hope is that self has an 

67
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,212
instance method called my func, in this case, and that my func 

68
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:41,216
is prepared to accept an argument. That's what's going on there. 

69
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,221
Remember, when we do this, okay, save yourself a lot of grief. 

70
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,224
When you see the notation a dot b, it means we're calling the 

71
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,228
method b on the object a. Okay, what does it not mean? It does 

72
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,231
not mean that b is an instance variable of a. It doesn't mean 

73
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,235
that a is some kind of a data structure, and b is one of the 

74
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,238
fields of that data structure – it's nothing like that, right? 

75
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,241
Keeping this in mind will help you parse Ruby expressions that 

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,244
look a little confusing until you get more accustomed to the 

77
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,246
language, at which point it'll seem very natural. Understanding 

78
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,249
this distinction, keeping this one simple rule in mind, will 

79
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,253
save you a lot of grief and confusion. When you say every 

80
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,257
operation is a method call, go a little more deeply into that. 

81
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,260
What does it mean? Here's three different uses of plus. Somebody 

82
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,265
unfamiliar with a modern extremely object- oriented language 

83
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,268
like Ruby might look at those three lines and say, " Wow, if 

84
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,271
those are all legal calls, it must be the case that Ruby has 

85
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,274
some pretty sophisticated type inference and type conversion in 

86
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,277
place so that plus knows what to do depending on what the types 

87
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,281
of its two arguments are." Now that you understand that 

88
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,283
everything is an object and plus is just a method, it should be 

89
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,286
clear that what's going on here is these are three different 

90
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,289
methods. These three uses of plus are three different methods. 

91
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,292
One of them is the class numeric definition of plus, another one 

92
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,296
is the array class's definition of plus, and another one is the 

93
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,299
string class's definition of plus. How does Ruby know which one 

94
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,302
to use? To take the third example here, when I say y equals 

95
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,305
quote hello plus quote world, what's the receiver of plus? The 

96
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,309
receiver is this first argument hello and it's a string. The 

97
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,313
string class is going to be the one where the plus method gets 

98
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,315
looked up, the plus method is going to get past a second 

99
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,318
argument, in this case world, and it had better know how to do 

100
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,321
something sensible with that argument. The answer to the 

101
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,324
question, " What if I say foo plus bar, and foo plus bar maybe 

102
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,327
are of different classes or of different types, what happens 

103
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,330
then?" In foo plus bar, foo is the receiver, plus gets sent to 

104
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,334
it, and it will get past the argument bar, and it has to decide 

105
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,337
whether it can do something sensible based on what kind of a 

106
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,339
thing bar is. One last thing before we get off of this quick 

107
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,343
intro topic. Poetry mode. I mentioned in a previous lecture that 

108
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,347
I'm a really big fan of the minimum number of marks on the page 

109
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,351
that make it easy and clear to write the code and for other 

110
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,354
people to read the code. One of the ways that Ruby supports this 

111
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,357
is through poetry mode. Here's an example of a legal Ruby 

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,360
statement that came from one of my apps using poetry mode. You 

113
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,362
can almost read it aloud and figure out what the code does. 

114
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,366
Redirect to login page and return unless logged in. Code does 

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,370
not get much more transparent than that. The reason this is 

116
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,373
legal is because when parentheses around function call arguments 

117
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,376
are optional, in other words when the parser would not be 

118
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,379
confused by omitting them, Ruby lets you omit them, and also 

119
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,382
because braces around hashes can often be omitted if the context 

120
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,386
is unambiguous. For example, if we rewrote this with fully 

121
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,390
parenthesized syntax, we could see that – redirect to login 

122
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,394
page, this redirect to is a method that expects one argument – 

123
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,397
and is a standard Boolean connector which you've seen before – 

124
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,401
return, in this case return isn't returning any explicit value 

125
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,405
so it's like a function call but there's no argument – and 

126
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,409
logged in happens to be another function; I didn't add the empty 

127
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,411
parens around it. Again, as you get used to the language, it'll 

128
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,415
become very natural and very clear to you when it's okay to 

129
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,417
leave stuff out. Here's another example. Dave alluded, in one of 

130
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,421
the earlier lectures, about the ability to write things like, a 

131
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,424
should be greater than or equal to seven when you're expressing 

132
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,426
test cases. How can that possibly work? Again, if we 

133
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,429
parenthesize defensively, should is really just a function that 

134
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,433
takes one argument. The argument that it takes is the 

135
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,436
expression " be greater than or equal to seven." In this case, I 

136
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,439
happen to know that b isn't a variable. It's actually another 

137
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:27,442
function call. It's a method call. In the poetry mode example, 

138
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,447
I've been able to omit both the empty parent around b, which 

139
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,451
tell us it's a function call with no arguments, and the parent 

140
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:39,454
around should which capture its argument. One last example, and 

141
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,459
this is an example of omitting braces when it's obvious from 

142
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,462
context that something is a hash. This is an example of a call 

143
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,466
that was very common in Rails applications saying to create a 

144
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,470
URL that links to a particular procedure in your program that 

145
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,474
handles some user interaction with the web app. What we've done 

146
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,477
here is there's actually two things we've omitted. This is a 

147
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,481
function of one argument and the argument is a hash. Because 

148
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,484
it's unambiguous in parsing, not only can we leave out the 

149
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,487
parens around the function argument, we can leave out the braces 

150
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,490
that normally would go around the hash literal. Now again, the 

151
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,493
first time you see this, it's a little confusing, you might not 

152
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,496
always realize when it's acceptable to do it and when it's not. 

153
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,498
When in doubt, you can always parenthesize defensively. In 

154
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,502
general, you'll very quickly get used to when this makes sense 

155
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,505
to do and you're going to find that it makes your code much more 

156
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,507
readable.
