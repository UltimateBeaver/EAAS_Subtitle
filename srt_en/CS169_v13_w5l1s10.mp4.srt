1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so that's a quick overview. Let's ... pretty sure you all 

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:07,003
follow this, but let's just make sure you were paying attention. 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,007
What's not true? What's false about Cucumber and Capybara? The 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,010
step definitions are Ruby and are similar to method calls, while 

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,015
steps are in English and are similar to method definitions. A 

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,019
feature has one or more Scenarios, which are typically composed 

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,023
of 3 to 8 Steps. Steps use given for the current state, when for 

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,027
the actions, and then for the consequences of actions. The 

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,031
fourth one is Cucumber matches step definitions to scenario 

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,034
steps using regular expressions, and Capybara pretends to be the 

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,037
user that interacts with SaaS app accordingly. A lot of words in 

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:48,041
this slide. Ready, set, vote. Okay. This is actually is a 

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:54,048
mixture of the first two. I want you to talk it over and see 

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:59,054
which it is and then we'll come back. All right. Let's try 

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,059
voting again, see if anything change. Ready, set, vote. Orange 

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:10,064
dominates here. So the fourth one is true. Step definitions ... 

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,070
Cucumber matches step definitions to scenario steps using 

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,073
regular expressions, and Capybara pretends. The steps are given 

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,077
for the current, when for action, and then for consequences.  . 

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
A feature has one or more Scenarios, which are typically 

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,082
composed of 3 to 8 Steps. What's wrong here? What's wrong about 

22
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:32,086
the first one? It's almost right. Just change a couple of words. 

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:38,092
Step definitions are Ruby and are similar to method definitions. 

24
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,098
It's like here's the step you're going to use a lot and the 

25
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:48,102
steps are like method calls. Steps are in English but they're 

26
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,108
similar to method calls and step definitions are Ruby and are 

27
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
similar to method definitions. Keep that in mind. Keeps the 

28
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,114
words ...
