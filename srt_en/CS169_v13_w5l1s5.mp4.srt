1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, we're almost done with CRUD; we've done create, we've done 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,004
read, and now we just have to do update and delete. The good 

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,007
news is you pretty much have now at least seen all of the basic 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,010
machinery. We're just going to be putting it together in 

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:17,012
different ways here. When we did the create action, we saw that 

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,017
doing a create really amounts to 2 interactions, when you're 

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,020
talking about a human- facing web service. There is getting the 

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,022
form to fill out, and then there's submitting the filled out 

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,025
form and those are 2 different controller actions, usually. By 

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,028
the way, I am going to point out, and we're going to come back 

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,029
to this in just a few minutes, that the idea that creating 

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,033
something is 2 actions, it's important to realize why that's an 

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:41,036
artifact of us doing a human- facing application. If you're 

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,041
thinking of Rotton Potatoes as a remote service that 

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,045
manages movie information reviews, then you would think, 

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,047
logically, creating a new movie listing is one action. It's, 

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,051
here's some data to create a new movie. Just create it and let 

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,053
me know if it succeeded. What we are going to see in a moment is 

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,056
that with basically a 1- line controller change, you can make 

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:03,058
the same logic in your app work for both a human- facing site, 

21
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,063
where the user has to do 2 interactions to do a create, as well 

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,066
as a service- orientated architecture- facing site, where it ‘ s 

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,068
a single action. You can basically repurpose your code to do 

24
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,071
that really trivially. Having said all that, the edit update 

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,075
action is exactly analogous, that if I want to edit information 

26
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,078
about an existing movie, I've got to do two things; I first have 

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,081
to get the existing information in front of me, usually in a 

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,084
form that already has the values prefilled, and then I have to 

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,087
be able to submit the form with the modified information. We're 

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,089
going to use the same technique in that the first action 

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,092
retrieves the form, the second action submits the form, and just 

32
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,096
as with create, at the end of our update action we'll use a 

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,099
redirect, in this case, back to the action that shows the movie 

34
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,102
details, rather than just having a view that says update 

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,105
successful, and nowhere to go from there. Now, what's different 

36
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,108
about this case is that, when you're creating a new movie, the 

37
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
initial form should be blank, but if you're editing an existing 

38
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
one, it makes more sense for the existing values to already be 

39
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:04,117
filled in. So, how would we do that? The edit update pair is 

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,124
really similar to what we've seen before. The difference is in 

41
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,126
the action. The edit action which is going to serve the form, is 

42
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,130
first going to grab the movie ID of which existing movie is 

43
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:19,134
being edited, and it's going to use that to populate this

44
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,139
@movie variable, so that when we first display the form, the 

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,142
existing information is going to, essentially, be pre- 

46
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,144
populated. Then, the update action looks a lot like the create 

47
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,148
action. We're just going to grab the ID of the movie to be 

48
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,150
updated; this is a difference, because before we were creating a 

49
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,153
brand new one, and we're going to call update_attributes, which 

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,156
you've seen. We're going to pass that hash of values that the 

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
user filled out on the form, and a flash message and a redirect. 

52
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,164
So, all of the same machinery, really, that applies to what we 

53
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:52,167
just did for the create action. The other difference is that, 

54
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,172
where we were using a post to do the creation of a new movie, 

55
00:02:55,175 --> 00:03:00,175
we're using a put to do the update of an existing movie. First 

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,180
of all, why is that, and second, how could we even do that given 

57
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,182
that web browsers generally only support get and post, but not 

58
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,186
put. What's going on there? Well, one reason here is that, 

59
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,190
again, Rails really is trying to say think about building a 

60
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,192
RESTful app first, and then secondarily think about how you 

61
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,196
would make a human- facing interface for it. During your design 

62
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,199
process, you really ought to be thinking in terms of RESTful 

63
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,201
actions. One way to distinguish different kinds of RESTful 

64
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,204
actions, as post versus a put, and it's becoming an increasingly 

65
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,207
common semantics, the put is what you use to update something in 

66
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,211
place, versus post is what you use to submit brand new 

67
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,214
information. It's sort of an emerging consensus. It's no problem 

68
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,218
to have different RESTful routes whose only distinction is which 

69
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,222
verb they use, whether they use put or post. Now, what about the 

70
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,225
second problem where web browsers can only generate either get 

71
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,228
or post actions; they can't generate puts. How do we do that? 

72
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:59,231
Well, happily, as it turns out, anticipating this very question, 

73
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,239
what happens in the Rails world if we actually specify method 

74
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,243
put, which is what we're going to have to do with this form, 

75
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,246
we're saying we want to trigger the RESTful action that updates, 

76
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,248
in place, existing information. But, what actually happens here 

77
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,252
is that, when html gets rendered from this, it will be rendered 

78
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,256
as a post, which the web browser knows how to handle, but there 

79
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,259
will be an additional hidden form field that is basically 

80
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,262
embedded in the form, and is a trigger to Rails to say this was 

81
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,265
supposed to really be a put, but web browsers don't know how to 

82
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,268
do a put, so on your way into the controller method, change the 

83
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,271
post into a put. It's interesting, so the effect of all this is 

84
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,274
that in your controller action, you can ask which HTTP method 

85
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,278
was used to submit this form, and the answer is, it was put, 

86
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,282
even though it really started out back on the web browser as a 

87
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,284
post. Again, why would you want to design Rails to support this 

88
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,287
behavior; it's because you're really designing a RESTful service 

89
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,291
interface, and you'd like the controller method to say, okay, 

90
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,293
I've got a put, and I got this verb; I know what that means, it 

91
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,296
means update. The only thing I really need to know is is the 

92
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,298
result going to be visible to a human, or the result going to 

93
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,301
another programmatic service. I want the semantic of put to be 

94
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,305
the same, whichever one of those 2 it is. This is a build up to 

95
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,308
the fact that, in a moment, I'm going show you exactly how to do 

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,310
that. Given that you can take my word for the fact that the put 

97
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,314
gets changed to a post, the only other thing we haven't done is 

98
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,319
destroy, which is simplicity itself. Remember we said destroy is 

99
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,322
an instance method and the reason for that is you would think 

100
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,326
that you call ... on a collection of movies, say destroy this 

101
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,329
one. But no, what you really want to do is destroy the instance, 

102
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,332
because you want to give it a chance to clean up after itself. 

103
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,335
That's a topic we'll talk about more when we start doing 

104
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,337
associations and advanced Rails methods. Because destroy is an 

105
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,340
instance method, we have the same strategy where we can find the 

106
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,343
movie first, based on the params hash. We can call destroy in 

107
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,347
it, and then we can include a little flash message to confirm 

108
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,350
that everything worked, and redirect somewhere interesting. 

109
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,353
Redirect is this general mechanism for saying I did what you 

110
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,356
wanted me to do, and rather than just show you a boring page 

111
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,358
that states that fact, I'll save you a step and take you back 

112
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,361
some place potentially more interesting. But, that's it'; you've 

113
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,365
basically now seen all of the CRUD actions that you can do, and 

114
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,368
the relatively small amount of machinery required to do them.
