00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, cost estimation in Agile. Sounds like an oxymoron. In the 

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,006
real world you need to estimate the cost before a customer's 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,008
going to agree on the project, but there's no careful planning 

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,011
and scheduling in Agile unlike [ planning of 00:13] documents 

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:19,014
like we'll talk about shortly. How can you estimate the cost? In 

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
fact, that's exactly the question … Armando and I had written 

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,022
versions of the book, we didn't have cost estimation in it, so 

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,024
we said, " Hey, how do you guys do this?" This is the answer. 

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,028
Pivotal Labs, they actually not only do they develop code they 

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,031
help teach the customer how to develop code by teaching them 

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:41,035
Agile. They never promise that we'll deliver these three 

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,041
features by this date. They don’ t do that. What they do instead 

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:50,045
is they're going to commit resources efficiently up until that 

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,050
date, and they'll work with the customer to define the 

15
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:59,053
priorities to see how things take. It's not a hitting a target 

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,059
based on features in a time window, it's estimating how much 

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,064
effort will be and then we'll see how it goes. Where do you 

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,068
think you get the estimate from? What's the steps they go 

19
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,071
through? First it starts off with a one- hour phone call. A 

20
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,075
person, a company's interested in working with Pivotal Labs. 

21
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,078
They call on the phone, and part of what they do on the phone is 

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
explain how things are done. This is not a contract, this is not 

23
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,084
outsourcing a contract of work to do. This is a joint effort 

24
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,087
with you and us. You need to make the time commitment for [ 

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,091
inaudible 01:32] and it's after the phone call that goes okay, 

26
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,093
they say, " Okay, why don't you come visit?" Then they have this 

27
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,096
hour and a half session that's called a scoping session. What 

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:44,099
they're doing is, is they are ... the customer has to bring 

29
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,104
everybody associated who has some idea about the design, whether 

30
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,106
it's design documents they have, developers and designers, 

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,110
anything that can clarify what has to be done. Pivotal brings 

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,115
two of their engineers, and they ask these questions. What 

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,118
they're trying to identify is there anything about the project 

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,120
that's going to be risky, risky in terms of the schedule, and 

35
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,124
try and work that out. As soon as the customer leaves, the 

36
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,128
engineers spend half an hour to try and make a guess of how long 

37
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,132
this is going to take. If it's not ... it seems pretty solid, 

38
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,136
the customer knows what they want, not much risk, then they 

39
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,138
say, " Okay, 20 to 22 weeks." If there's a large uncertainty, 

40
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,142
it'll have a bigger range. They say, " Well, we think it's going 

41
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,144
to be somewhere between 18 and 26 weeks." Then what the manager 

42
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:32,148
does, " Well, it's that many weeks, it's that many programmers," 

43
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,152
we multiply that out, add a small profit. It's time and 

44
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,154
material. That's the Agile model. " We're going to make our best 

45
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,158
effort based ... and this is how much it's going to cost. 

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,161
This'll be our cost to you, so are you happy with that?" Okay, 

47
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,165
so that's how Agile costing is done.
