00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay. That let's do a peer questions to see if you communicate

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:14,009
thing well. Which statement is false about Waterfall, Spiral, 

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,014
and Rational Unified Process Lifecycles? All rely on careful 

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,016
planning, and measure progress against the plan. All reply on 

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,020
thorough documentation. All reply on a manager to be in charge 

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:28,023
of the project. All use iteration and prototypes. All right. See 

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,028
how many people can get this, and how many people haven't lost 

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:38,031
their card. Okay. Ready, set ... Okay. Vote. All right. As I 

9
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,038
suspected, that's pretty straightforward. Yes. The right answer 

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:48,043
is the fourth one. The incorrect answer is the fourth one. All 

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,048
use iteration and prototypes. That waterfall doesn't use 

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,051
iteration prototypes, but the others do. All right.
