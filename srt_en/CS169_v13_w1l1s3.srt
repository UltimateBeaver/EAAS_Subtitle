1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Alright let's start with software as a service. So it's like you 

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,007
know here's a laundry where you can rent laundry machines don't 

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,009
have to have your own washer and dryer and you are going to just 

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,011
rent them with the same thing's true do you wanna rent your 

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,015
software than own it yourself so here's what traditionally 

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,018
happens you get this binary you download on your device that has 

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,021
to work with the right version of hardware and software. And and 

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,025
that means developers have to take a long time to make sure that 

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,029
the software runs with all kinds of combinations of operating 

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:37,031
systems. And with hardware devices. Um so isn't there a better 

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,037
way to do this where you only have to work on one platform and 

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,039
if you could it'd be fewer release cycles no user upgrades and 

13
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,043
that's what it gets called a software a service so the software 

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,046
in the data gets deliberate over the Internet that something 

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,050
program like the browser running on a client device. So you know 

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,054
search social networking is examples of software as a service. 

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,057
It's so popular now that even traditional software like 

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,060
Microsoft office or turbo tax instead of buying software 

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:09,064
installing it you can rent it you can use it um way and so 

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,069
Armando and I think this is not just a fad that's gonna go way 

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,073
we think this is a fundamental change that this is a revolution 

22
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,076
in how software is being made in we're seeing the impact of that 

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
this decade you read the newspaper lots of things are happening 

24
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,084
today in Microsoft reorganising buying companies and stuff like 

25
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,086
that and something we think this is fundamentally the shift from 

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,090
software that you put on your shrink wrap software that's offers 

27
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,093
a service that's gonna play out over this decade. So why's it so 

28
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:42,097
popular I know installation worries is like user it's gonna work 

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,102
you know we're not gonna have about different hardware 

30
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,104
capability or you instal the wrong version. We don't have to 

31
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,108
worry lose your cell phone the date is up in the cloud you 

32
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
haven't lost your data if you're gonna have people working 

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
together it's naturally to do in the cloud it's easy for them to 

34
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,117
interact if the data is gigantic or changes all the time you 

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,122
don't wanna have to send the data to all people it's in the 

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,124
cloud is one copy it's easy to keep up to date for the software 

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,128
developer. It's great there's only one copy of software it only 

38
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,131
has to work on one set of hardware one operating system. So 

39
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,135
there's no hassle for developers and then one of the benefits of 

40
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,138
it is it's in the cloud before you bring in a new feature you 

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,141
can try on a small fraction the users that's gonna be A B 

42
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:29,144
testing you know one percent of them at time and finally there 

43
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:35,149
is no upgrade so that the upgrades feel for the users they don't 

44
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,155
have to it seems like every time I turn my computer I've gotta 

45
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,158
give permission something to upgrade it and the that's a lot 

46
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,162
simpler for the developers as well so they can control the 

47
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,166
environment. So that's the reason for SaaS So what's a good 

48
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,169
programming environment for SaaS there's a lot of them SaaS 

49
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,173
apart there's lots and lots of languages but we use ruby on 

50
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:01,176
rails which is called rails in short rails is a really popular 

51
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:07,181
framework it's get used by Twitter for example but it's it's a 

52
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,187
reason that it's so popular is got a really great programming 

53
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,190
language in fact the inventor of rails picked ruby which is not 

54
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,194
a very popular languages because of it's great features. So 

55
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,197
rails a ruby is a modern scripting language it's both functional 

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,200
and object oriented has of course automatic memory management it 

57
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,204
has dynamic types it has reuse via mix-ins and closures and and 

58
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,208
lots of programming to learn about that so why don't think ruby 

59
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,211
on rails causes a lot to learn in this course but you only got 

60
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,214
twelve weeks to learn it you get twelve weeks to learn them. But 

61
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,217
either you're like you're taking four courses so you divide that 

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,220
twelve weeks by four you got three weeks full time to learn all 

63
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,223
the stuff or people working yeah you're taking the MOOC are 

64
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,226
working full time so you only have a slim about time. So we want 

65
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,229
very productive so there's a lot of things you learn in this 

66
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:59,233
class we need to be used this productively and in is we wrote an 

67
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,239
article about the so that's why we're gonna take some of the 

68
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,242
time of the class to learn a new programming language new 

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,246
framework as beating gonna get multiplied that the other reason 

70
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,249
is that's but software engineering in software engineering is 

71
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,252
lifelong learning so why but the people are taking MOOC are 

72
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,256
taking this class because it's software can musically need 

73
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,258
learning things just happen all the rest of your careers. So 

74
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,261
we'll give you the chance to do that in this class students 

75
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,264
class if you don't like learning things you think this is this a 

76
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,267
a good field for you because it what's amazing about Morris law 

77
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,271
is allows new things to happen all the time. Okay
