1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, let's ask some questions about it; see if you followed

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:07,003
everything I said there. Which of these things regarding cost is

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:11,007
true? Three should be false. As practitioners of Agile

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,011
Development, Pivotal Labs does not use contracts. As

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,015
practitioners of pair programming, Pivotal Labs estimates the

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,018
cost for one pair to do it, and assigns that pair to complete

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,022
the project. The cost bid is for Pivotal Labs time and materials

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,026
that covers the number of weeks in the estimate, as studies show

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,029
that 84 to 90% of projects are on time and on budget, plan and

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,032
document managers promise customers a set of features for

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:42,035
agreed- upon cost by agreed upon date. Which of these is true?

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,042
Okay, you guys are already ready. Ready, set, vote. All right.

13
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:52,046
That is againâ€¦ I'm an easy question answer. The last one there

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:58,052
is, I'm still stunned that 84 to 90% of projects are over

15
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,058
budget and on time, so I'll keep throwing that out. The plan as

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,062
we'll see; the plan and document managers do promise customers

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,064
a set of features for an agreed- upon cost by an agreed- upon

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:13,068
date, despite the fact that 84 to 90% of all projects haven't

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:18,073
done that. Nevertheless, that's what a project manager does.

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,078
Pivotal Labs does not use contracts. They do use contracts, but

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,081
it's a contracts that's based on effort. There's a contract

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:30,084
that's signed, but it's not for features. Pivotal Labs assigns

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,090
the cost in pairs. They do. They actually, because they believe

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,092
in pair programming, they actually say it's pair weeks. They

25
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,096
don't just assign one pair to do it. They can assign as many

26
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,099
pairs as makes sense. You don't want to have too many people

27
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,102
that they can get in each other way and too much time

28
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,104
communicating, but they'll figure out the scoping of the

29
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,107
project and assign people to do it, so it will be done in less

30
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,109
time. More than one pair works on it, so they do actually bid in

31
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,112
pair weeks. It's based on the time and materials that cover the

32
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,116
weeks in the estimate. That was kind of an easy answer.
