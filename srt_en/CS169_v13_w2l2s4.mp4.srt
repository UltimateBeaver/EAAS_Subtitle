1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
With all that in mind, let's ask a question about instance

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:08,003
variables and their friends. Let's hypothetically assume, and in 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,008
a moment we'll show that this is not hypothetical, you could 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,010
really do this, that we could add stuff to Ruby's built- in 

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,013
string class. Here's a super useful method called 'curvy' that 

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:21,017
basically will return true if the upper case version of the 

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,021
string includes, or it fails to include, any curvy 

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:30,025
characters ... fails to include any curvy characters. Don't 

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,030
worry too much about the functionality of curvy. What I'd like 

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,032
to know is, which of these is the way that you would call it? 

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,036
Would you call it string. curvy? Would you call it directly on a 

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:47,040
string receiver? So think about that for a moment. Initial vote. 

13
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:52,047
Wow, okay, lots and lots of votes for green. You guys have been 

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,052
doing your work in advance. I like that. So, let's understand 

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,055
why green is the correct answer. First of all, the way that I 

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,059
defined the curvy method, what kind of a method incidence is it? 

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,061
An instance or a class method? In our previous definition, we 

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,065
saw that to define a class method, you have to name it self. 

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,069
method name or you could use the name of the class. If we had 

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,072
said def string. curvy, that would have been a class method, but 

21
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,076
curvy is being defined as an instance method, so certainly the 

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,079
first choice is out because this is a call to a class method, 

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,081
right? This is a call on the receiver string and string is a 

24
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:30,084
class. What about these guys over here? Let's look at curvy foo. 

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,090
Curvy is defined as not taking any arguments, so anything like 

26
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,094
this, choice 3 or choice 4, has to be wrong because we're trying 

27
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,097
to pass an argument, but the function isn't written to take one. 

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,101
On the other hand, the reason that the green choice is right in 

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,103
this case is because when you're calling an instance method of 

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,107
something, the value of self in an instance method, very much 

31
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,111
like in Java, the value of this is the value of the object that 

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,115
received the method call. So, hopefully that clarifies it for 

33
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,119
the people who didn't get it, but most of you got it right and 

34
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,122
well done.
