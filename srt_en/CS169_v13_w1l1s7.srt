1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Right next segment is about cloud computing. So the question is 

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,006
so all these people are using these services like a Google 

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,010
search and Youtbe and Ebay and Amazon all that stuff. What's the 

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,015
hardware to use? What all these companies use to have millions 

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,018
of customers? Do they use supercomputers in these giant 

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,021
expensive computers are mainframe computers these kind of gold 

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,024
plated things that almost never fail. So that's a question. 

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,028
Another question is will suppose I don't work for those 

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,030
companies? I've got this great idea, but I'm I would love to be 

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,034
able to millions of users but, do I have to build a warehouse 

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,037
computer and spend a get some venture capitalists to invest a 

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
hundred million dollars in my idea? And we don't even know it 

13
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:48,043
works. So, am I can be shut out? Right? So what's the answer to 

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,048
this? It turns out, let's first list what you need right. To do 

15
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,052
software as a service over the internet you need to communicate 

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,055
to interact with that service you need scalability so what does 

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,059
that mean? So, if you're doing like a photo sharing service in 

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,062
it's right around Halloween you know that suddenly all these 

19
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,066
photos are gonna show up and you're gonna need a lot more 

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:13,068
computing. Or, if you're doing sales of like Amazon does around 

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,073
Christmas there's going to be this huge demand but the rest of 

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,075
the year not so much. You have to be able to scale up to be able 

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,078
to handle the load "'cause" if you can't scale to handle the 

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
load, then customers get frustrated and go to your competitor. 

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,083
It has to work you've only got one copy of the the software. You 

26
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,087
only have one copy the hardware, if that one goes down you're 

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,090
off the air. You're not making money and you're making customers 

28
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,092
mad. If you know with shrink wrapped software you can you know 

29
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,096
of you have millions of copies if you crash so what. Right? If 

30
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,099
this is the only copy it's gotta work. So what the hardware that 

31
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:47,102
people ended up doing was clusters. Clusters actually got 

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,107
started here at Berkeley is part of the network of workstations 

33
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
project that Armando and I are involved in. With the cluster is 

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,114
is you put a a bunch of computers together like like P. C.s are 

35
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,118
workstations. And you connect them with ethernet switches. So, 

36
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,122
just like what's in the buildings here on campus but you 

37
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,125
dedicate them for this service you wanna provide. Now what 

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:15,129
happened was and that this proved to be much more scalable data 

39
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,135
network as a fundamentally more scalable and then other choices 

40
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:25,138
out there it was a lot cheaper. The people's purposal in Louise 

41
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,145
Verosa wrote a book about warehouse scaled computers make things 

42
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,147
about a factor twenty cheaper. So, for the same amount 

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,150
computation or disk storage or memory it cost twenty times as 

44
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,153
much to buy the book gold plated stuff from the mainframe like 

45
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:42,156
I. B. M. versus P. C.s and the way they get dependability in 

46
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,162
clusters is to have a lot of redundant copies. So if it's twenty 

47
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,164
times cheaper you can afford to have three replicas of 

48
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,167
everything it's still you know one seventh the cost of gold 

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,170
plated version, so they just it's. The parts aren't very 

50
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,173
dependable but you have a triplicate them and so the 

51
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,176
collectively software makes that dependable. And it turns out if 

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,180
you have thousands of computers all, pretty much the same, all 

53
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,183
running the same software, they're not that hard to manage. So, 

54
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:11,186
that a few operators can handle thousands of servers and then as 

55
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,191
we talked earlier a virtual machines can really help make this 

56
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:19,194
work so that's another thing that can simplify the task. So 

57
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,199
warehouse scale computers soon grew yeah the first ones had 

58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,204
maybe a thousand servers, but as customers increased over time. 

59
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,207
They have now a hundred thousand servers is demand increased 

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,210
what they discovered is when you build a warehouses heaters you 

61
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,215
order a hundred thousand computers at the time you get huge 

62
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,218
amount of timings to scale. If you were to go Dell or H. P. and 

63
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,222
say I want hundred thousand computers they're gonna give your 

64
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,225
really good deal. If you're gonna build a warehouse rather than 

65
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,228
just for a thousand computers, but a hundred thousand that's 

66
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,231
much more efficient way to build it and if you get network 

67
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,234
bandwidth by the you know you gigabits this opposed to by the 

68
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,237
megabits that's much cheaper that way. So by factors of three or 

69
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,241
eight, so I factors of three or eight per computers it was 

70
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,243
cheaper to do the warehouse scaled computing. Also, what happens 

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,247
is traditional data centers are underutilized so there was a 

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,250
hundred data centers used for the thousands computers maybe 

73
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,253
these ten or twenty percent of the time to consolidate them 

74
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,256
together to get more utilization. So, what ends up happening in 

75
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,261
particular starting with amazon, they realized they can earn 

76
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,264
money to offer a pay as you go service, because their costs are 

77
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,268
so much less that they could sell for less than the customer 

78
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,271
cost, but they still make a profit. And so the characteristic of 

79
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:40,275
this, what's called utility computing or public cloud computing 

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,280
is that offers a computation storage communication at pennies 

81
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,283
per hour and remarkably there's no cost for scaling. Usually, if 

82
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,287
you wanna a thousand times faster computer you pay a lot more 

83
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,290
than a thousand times more for that privilege. Here a thousand 

84
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,294
years one hours the same price is one computer four thousand 

85
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:02,297
hours. Their job that companies are providing us to makes you 

86
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,302
think you have as many computers as you want and their job is to 

87
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,305
fulfill that pledge, which is a very attractive and Amazon Web 

88
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,309
Services Google App Engine, and Microsoft Asure were the leading 

89
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,312
ones to do this. Over the years now Amazon's been doing this 

90
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,315
about seven years I think they're model has won, so now Google 

91
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,318
App Engine, Microsoft Azure are pretty much imitating what 

92
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,321
Amazon Web Services has done and so the slides took together 

93
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,325
which is now there's seventeen different types of instances that 

94
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,329
you can get there. The the original one the small one which 

95
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,333
seven years ago was ten cents an hour is now six cents an hour 

96
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,337
and that's kind of the building block you see things the cost 

97
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,340
seventy five times as much down here. And you can see things 

98
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,344
with a hundred times as much memory or a hundred times as much 

99
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,347
computing. All kinda flavors different one so you can whatever 

100
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,350
your task is you pick the one you pay the price so when Amazon 

101
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,354
came out and they said they announced doing things for ten cents 

102
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,357
an hour and you say oh they gotta be losing money doing that. 

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Well that was seven years ago with Moore's law right. So seven 

104
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,363
years later they went from ten cents an hour to six cents per 

105
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,366
hour. Only forty percent drop despite Moore's seven years of 

106
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,369
Moore's Law, which could be a factor of a hundred cheaper, so 

107
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,372
that they are perceived as making up a lot of money doing this. 

108
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,375
I went to a conference last year from Amazon their first public 

109
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,379
conference. And they said a remarkable statement they said every 

110
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:29,384
day they rollout is many servers as it took to run Amazon.com in 

111
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,389
two thousand three one of the five billion dollar your six 

112
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,392
thousand employee company. So in the beginning when this started 

113
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,395
the person who made the argument for Amazon to get into this is 

114
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,398
we have all these computers we only need them near Christmas. 

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Let's rent them out the other eleven months per year. Well then 

116
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,403
it's an interesting argument what happens across Christmas 

117
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,406
right. Well they got started in it and suddenly became so 

118
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,409
popular that roles reversed now Amazon.com, where you go buy 

119
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,414
books they don't have any computers they're just a client of 

120
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,418
Amazon web services they're relatively small client of Amazon 

121
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,421
Web Service and Netflix and many others are doing that. So and 

122
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,424
and the rolling I don't know five thousand servers today I don't 

123
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,428
know how many servers they're putting out. Another thing we did 

124
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,432
kind of show off was that they could build a supercomputer out 

125
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,435
of these rented services. So they put five hundred these larger 

126
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,439
ones together and they were able to do two hundred forty tera 

127
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,442
flops which at times but the top one hundred of the fastest five 

128
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,446
hundred supercomputers in the world. That cost about thirteen 

129
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,448
hundred dollars an hour. So that you can rent a a supercomputer 

130
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,452
with your credit card to take advantage of this? Well when Zynga 

131
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,456
did Farm Vill and they could've built their own data center, 

132
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,458
then go to venture capitalists and say what we need a bunch of 

133
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,461
servers to do this the biggest online game before that happened 

134
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,464
five million users so we need of servers five million that's or 

135
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,468
maybe that's that's the biggest ones will start small. 

136
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,471
Fortunately, for them they went to Amazon Web Services and so 

137
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,474
every time the number of customers increase they just increased 

138
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:04,477
their credit card limit and got more servers. So in the for four 

139
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,484
days they went up to a million you know. From zero to million in 

140
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,487
four days. In two months ten million, nine months of seventy 

141
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,490
five million. If it hadn't been on Amazon Web Services they 

142
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,493
couldn't have done that. So, that they're able to take in as 

143
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,496
much income as they could get computers. So, without having to 

144
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,499
do that. So, think about that for a a minute you all heard of 

145
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:27,502
the jeopardy champion Watson. So, that bottom harbours about 

146
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,507
ninety these servers let's say we we picked one that's like two 

147
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,511
hundred dollars an hour. So what's two hundred dollars an hour 

148
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,514
that's like what you know what these people we talked about 

149
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,516
earlier an attorney or accountant is paid. A good attorney or 

150
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,520
accountant gets paid two hundred dollars an hour Think about in 

151
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,525
your careers as machine learning starts to work and A.I. starts 

152
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:52,527
to work kinda for what task is A.I. as good as a highly trained 

153
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,532
person two hundred dollars an hour. That's today's prices is 

154
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,535
right? It's gonna go down. So, what is gonna mean for society 

155
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,538
right? What this is going to mean is computers get smarter can 

156
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,541
do more things. And we know what jobs are out there I have this 

157
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,545
sense that we're this you know tremendously efficient job 

158
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,549
killing industry. I think the reason I think the reason 

159
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,553
attorneys is to be pretty cool jobs is dropping. I think it's 

160
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,555
got to do computer technology. They're good at discovering 

161
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,558
things that they use to use law clerks to do. So, yeah so this 

162
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,562
is a really good job this is this is a good one to pick, cause 

163
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,566
I'm sure there's gonna be a demand for this I just hope that 

164
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,568
we're gonna start getting into the job generating side of 

165
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:31,571
things.
