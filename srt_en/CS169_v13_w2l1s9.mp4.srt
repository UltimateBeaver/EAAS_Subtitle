1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Alright, with that, which expression is true regarding pair

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
programing? Pair programming is quicker, better quality, cheaper 

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,009
and less effort than solo programming. The driver works on tasks 

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,013
at hand, the observer thinks strategically about future tasks. A 

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,017
pair will eventually figure out who is the best driver and who 

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
is the best observer, and then stick to these roles. My 

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,022
favourite answer, promiscuous pairing is one long- term solution 

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:33,026
to the problem of shortage of programmers. I thought it was 

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:44,033
goodness. Ready, set, vote. There's a mix of orange and green. 

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:50,044
Talk it over and then we'll have the [ technology 00:00:47]. 

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,050
Talk it over and we'll vote. Let's try and vote again, ready, 

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:59,052
set, vote. Mix of green and ... it is much greener. Pair 

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,059
programming is quicker, better quality, cheaper and less effort. 

14
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,062
There's a study that may not be less efforts. That's why that 

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:10,064
one isn't true. The driver works on tasks at hand, the observer 

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,070
thinks strategically about future tasks. Second one, that's what 

17
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,072
I thought was true. It's not promiscuous pairing doesn't 

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:23,075
increase the number of programmers. Thankfully I guess. That's 

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,083
human nature for one person to try and drive and a person to 

20
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,086
observe. That's not how this system works. You're really 

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,089
supposed to go back and forth. It will be better for you and 

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,090
better for the [ person 00:01:31].
