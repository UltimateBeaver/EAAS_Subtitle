1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
With that let's do another one of these things what is not true 

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,006
about software and servers for service oriented architecture in 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,008
cloud computing clusters are collections of commodity servers 

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,011
connected by land switches internet supplies the communication 

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,015
Saas apps that cloud computing uses hardware cluster and 

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,017
software using redundancy predict that the bill private data 

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,020
centres could match the cost of warehouse scale computers if 

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,023
they just use the same type of hardware and software And, ready, 

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,027
set alright okay this is this is this is these are just too easy 

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:37,031
yeah you'll hear people say this who have private data centres 

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,037
well if I use the same software when you Eucalyptus software 

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,040
that buy the same PCs they don't have any same price advantage 

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,044
but it's economies of scale that they don't get when they do 

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:57,046
that I alright the next we're going to do some terms about what 

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,057
type of software we hope you will build. So why do I care if 

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,061
what others think in my code if works does it matter what looks 

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,065
like. Well that's the kind of the motto, who cares what it looks 

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,069
like is a what's called legacy code. It's what that means a 

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,073
software that keeps meeting customers needs but its difficulty 

20
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,076
evolve due to inelegant or antiquated technology so give you an 

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
idea is we had to give an alternative that which we call 

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,084
beautiful code that does make the needs but on the other hand is 

23
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,087
easy to evolve so it's high quality software. So sixty percent 

24
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,091
of the cost of software maintenance is adding functionality 

25
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:39,094
legacy software versus just 17 percent for fixing bugs. So the 

26
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:44,099
thing was kind of we knew about legacy code but this is 

27
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,104
something that's tradition left out of software engineering 

28
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,107
courses and textbooks so when we Armando and I figure out what 

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,110
to do teach software engineering we went to talk to these half 

30
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:57,113
dozen companies who know how to build software like Google and 

31
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,117
Amazon in places like that. And they said the number one 

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:06,121
question every single company was the students need to learn to 

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,126
deal with un-documented legacy code. So the first three 

34
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,129
companies went to we tried to argue with them and "no you don't 

35
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,131
wanna say that" because we did not do it but after the fourth, 

36
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,134
fifth, and sixth we said okay we gotta do that so while we're 

37
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,138
gonna do that in this course. So we'll have lectures the talk 

38
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,142
about how you deal with like this legacy code in a programming 

39
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,145
assignment later in the course where you will deal with legacy 

40
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,149
code I'll show you the surveys later we also survey the alumni 

41
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,153
from this course to see what was important. And we certainly 

42
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,156
alumni from the course who were still in school hadn't graduated 

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,160
and the alumni who had gone to industry in that people still in 

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,163
school you know we need legacy might be okay to people in who 

45
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,167
from the course who are alumni in industry this is right at the 

46
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,169
top of their list you have to deal with legacy legacy code so 

47
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,174
that's what we're gonna do
