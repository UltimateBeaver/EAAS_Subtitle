1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's talk about actual object orientation in Ruby. I've kept 

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,004
saying this mantra, everything is an object, everything is a 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,008
method call, Ruby's a dynamic language, so the question is, why 

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,012
should you actually care about this? How does it actually 

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,013
simplify object- oriented programming? Let's look at a simple 

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:21,017
example to walk through. I'm going to define a savings account 

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,021
and hypothetically I'm going to say it inherits from an existing 

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,024
class called account, although we don't have an existing class. 

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,026
I just wanted to show you the syntax for inheritance. Of course, 

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,029
I need a constructor, and in Ruby, the constructor for a class 

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,032
by default is called initialize. Why is it called initialize, 

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,036
but you call it with new? It's just the way the world is. Sorry, 

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,038
kids. What is this initializer going to do? It's going to take 

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,042
one argument which is the initial balance, and note that because 

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,045
of giving the argument an optional value or a default value in 

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,049
the function definition, I can actually call the new function 

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,053
with no arguments and balance will default to zero. So you can 

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,056
have optional arguments with default values in Ruby as well. 

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,060
When I call the constructor, it's going to take the balance that 

20
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,063
I passed in and assign it to an instance variable. Long ago, in 

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,067
a previous lecture, we said that instance variables begin with a 

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,070
single @ sign, so @ balance is an instance variable, not to be 

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,074
confused with just plain balance, no @ sign. That's just a plain 

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,077
old local variable that disappears once we're no longer in the 

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
scope of the function. So that's the only thing the constructor 

26
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,082
does. Now we have a local variable or instance variable in Java 

27
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,086
terminology to track the value of our account balance, but of 

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,090
course, we need to be able to get access to that. Unlike Java 

29
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,093
and some other languages, there's no notion of a public 

30
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,095
attribute. This instance variable, @ balance, is visible only 

31
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,099
from within this specific instance of the object. If somebody 

32
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:46,102
outside the object, and certainly outside of the class, wants to 

33
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,106
get access to that information, you have to define an accessor 

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,110
for it. So here's my simple accessor. Wow, I hope you got that. 

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,114
All it does is return ... and by the way, in Ruby functions, if 

36
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,118
there's no explicit return statement, the value of the last 

37
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,121
expression evaluated in the function is the return value. 

38
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,124
Everything has a return value and if you don't say return, what 

39
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,127
you get is the last expression evaluated. So there's my really 

40
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,130
simple accessor, or getter, if you prefer. I also need a way 

41
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,134
maybe to set the balance. Who knows? Maybe I'd like to launder 

42
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,137
money into my bank account. Here's another function, and yes, 

43
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,141
balance= is the name of a method. Remember I said everything is 

44
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,145
a method call? This is where we're starting to get serious. 

45
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,149
Balance= is a different method from balance. There's a special 

46
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,152
case in Ruby for methods that end in the equal sign and that's 

47
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,156
how you can define your own setters. So balance= will take a new 

48
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,159
amount and it'll just set the instance variable to that. Of 

49
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,162
course, real bank accounts are not quite this easy to add money 

50
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,164
to yourself, so we'll get more realistic in a moment. We can 

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,167
also deposit. That's easy enough, we just add the deposit amount 

52
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,170
on to the instance variable balance. We can also have class 

53
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,175
variables. Something like the name of the bank might be a 

54
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,178
variable that is independent of any particular instance and we 

55
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,181
get those with the double @@ sign. Again, class variables are 

56
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,185
accessible from within the class. If we wanted to have access to 

57
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,188
that variable from outside the class, we would have to design a 

58
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,191
specific getter for it, and here would be an example of that 

59
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,195
getter. Notice the difference in how we define it. We define 

60
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,198
self. bank_ name. The reason this works, and this is going to 

61
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,201
take a little bit of getting used to, is because once we've 

62
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,204
started this declaration class, inside of this declaration, the 

63
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,208
value of self is the new class being created. So, if we say def 

64
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,212
self. some method name, all we're really saying is we're really 

65
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,215
defining this method on the class itself as opposed to these 

66
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,218
methods which are being defined on an instance of the class. 

67
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,221
Right on? We'll just return the bank name. Notice that we're not 

68
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,225
providing a setter for the bank name class variable, so you 

69
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:54,228
can't set it. An alternative to saying self. bank_ name is we 

70
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,234
could also put the name of the class. bank_ name. Why is that? 

71
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,238
Because inside of a class definition, the value of self is 

72
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,241
exactly the new class that you're in the process of creating. 

73
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,244
That's the end of our class definition. In a moment, I'm going 

74
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,247
to fire up the Ruby interpreter so that we can actually try 

75
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,250
these examples live in real life, but before we do that, let's 

76
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,254
test your recollection here. Remember that I said, remember, 

77
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:22,257
everything is an object, everything is a method call, a. b ... 

78
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:29,262
okay. Which ones of these are a correct way of getting access to 

79
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:34,269
the balance of a bank account instance? Let's do a quick initial 

80
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,274
vote. Quick initial vote. You guys are quick. You guys are 

81
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,279
quick. A sea of blue is what I see. Let's discuss the answer. 

82
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,284
What's wrong with A? Volunteer from the audience. What is 

83
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:54,287
manifestly wrong with A? One possibility is you can't directly 

84
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,294
access @ balance and while that is true, there's an even more 

85
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,298
superficial reason why the first one's wrong. Sir? There's no 

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,300
method called @ balance. There's no method called @ balance. A. 

87
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,304
b always means call method b on object a. Method names don't 

88
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,308
ever begin with an @ sign, only instance variable names can 

89
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,310
begin with an @ sign. So on its face, a just doesn't work. It's 

90
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,314
not even syntactically legal. B and c are equivalent, except 

91
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,318
that one of them omits the optional parentheses around the 

92
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,321
method call to balance, and that's it. So, back into our 

93
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:30,325
discussion, I am now going to actually take some code and paste 

94
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:37,330
it into the Ruby interpreter. I also took the liberty of 

95
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,337
creating three accounts we can play with, my account with $ 

96
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,340
1,000, Dave's with $ 5,000, and Bill Gates with a lot more than 

97
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:52,344
either of us. So we'll come back to that. Now you know instance 

98
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,352
variables. You know that you have define explicit getters and 

99
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,355
setters on instance variables. On the other hand, the getters 

100
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,359
and setters that we defined are pretty darn trivial, and it 

101
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,362
would be nice ... this to me, as soon as you start seeing stuff 

102
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,365
like this where you've read this method and now you know what's 

103
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,368
coming, this is a sign that the language isn't supporting you. 

104
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,372
Might there be a more concise way? If these accessors and 

105
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,376
setters are such a common case, shouldn't there be a way to 

106
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:23,378
support them that is a little more elegant and indeed there is. 

107
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:29,383
Let me do that again. Old way. New way. I just made code 

108
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:35,389
disappear. What is this magic attr_ accessor thing? It's not 

109
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:40,395
part of the language. It is just a regular old method call, and 

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
in a moment, we're going to start talking more about 

111
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,402
metaprogramming, which is code that defines and writes and runs 

112
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,405
new code at runtime, and one thing I said when I began 

113
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,409
introducing Ruby is, I'm only going to talk about these 

114
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,412
highfalutin language features because I believe they help you 

115
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,415
write cleaner code that is easier to read and understand. This 

116
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,418
is an example. In fact, in the next homework assignment, one of 

117
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,422
the things you're going to do is you're going to essentially 

118
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,423
create your own more sophisticated version of attr_ accessor. 

119
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,428
But when you say attr_ accessor  : balance, what you're saying 

120
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,431
is please create for me these two methods, a default getter and 

121
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,435
a default setter, that just do the obvious thing. You can figure 

122
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,438
out how it does it. If you had to print out the text of those 

123
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,441
two methods based on attr_ accessor, you could do it. The 

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,445
difference is, in Ruby, pretty much if you can print it out at 

125
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,447
runtime, you can also execute it at runtime, and that's very 

126
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,450
cool. So, a quick review of Ruby's distinguishing features that 

127
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,454
we've seen. First of all, it is object- oriented in the extreme. 

128
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,457
Even the lowliest integers are objects. There's really no such 

129
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,461
things as attributes. There's instance variables, but you have 

130
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,464
to define explicit getters and setters because you have to get 

131
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:52,467
at them through methods. Everything is a method call. Usually 

132
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,472
the only thing you care about in a method call is whether the 

133
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,474
receiver responds to the method you're trying to send it, and 

134
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,476
we'll have a lot more to say about that in a moment when we 

135
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,479
shortly talk about duck typing. We've talked about the fact that 

136
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,482
objects can have different types, but the variables that refer 

137
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,485
to those objects are not typed. As we'll see, most of the 

138
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,489
expressions that we've seen are non- destructive, so we gave 

139
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,492
examples of like adding strings together, adding arrays 

140
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,494
together. We're going to see some functions that let you select 

141
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,498
and remove elements and rearrange arrays. In almost all cases, 

142
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,502
with a few exceptions that we'll identify, those functions don't 

143
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,504
modify the receiver. They return a new copy of an object. That's 

144
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,508
part of Ruby's heritage as being functionally flavored from the 

145
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,512
functional programming community.
