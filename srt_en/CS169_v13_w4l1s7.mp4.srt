1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We talked about User Stories and how much work the hour but how 

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,005
do you know whether you've got a good one or a bad one? Like is 

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:13,008
it too big or is it too hard, and is actually useful as it have 

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:18,013
business value. Another acronym that we came up with as part of 

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:23,018
this is SMART. A good User Story is specific, Measurable, 

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,023
Achievable in a single iteration, Relevant and we'll talk about 

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,027
what the Five Why's are and Timeboxed you know when to give up 

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:37,030
so let's go over those, what make a SMART User Story. Specific 

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,037
and measurable are kind of related that each scenario is 

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,040
testable. It implies known that for every good input, you what 

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,045
the results going to be, so you can tell whether it does it or 

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,048
not. The anti- example here is the User Interface should be 

13
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,052
friendly. All right. Let's see how are we going to test and 

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:58,054
measure that ... who knows, that is not something he measure so 

15
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:03,058
it's got to be something like, response time has to be 90% of 

16
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,063
the time in less than three seconds. In typical, we'll do this [ 

17
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:11,066
inaudible 00:01:08] format of of given some specific conditions 

18
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,071
when I do X then what's the consequences of that? That will be 

19
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,075
when it has that format, it tends to be more specific and more 

20
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:22,077
measurable. How about achievable? Achievable in this case 

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,082
means [ inaudible 00:01:23] is completing it in the single 

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,085
iteration because if you can't do it in one [ inaudible 

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,088
00:01:28] and go do a subset of the stories but you're always 

24
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,091
aiming have, remember the agile premises, the prototype is 

25
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,094
always working at the end of iteration so you can show them to 

26
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,097
the customer. If you're getting less than one story for 

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,100
iteration, you got to get better at making your estimates to 

28
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:48,102
points to be able to do that so you break it down. Relevant part 

29
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,108
of SMART is it has business values, so for those of us who 

30
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
aren't business majors, what are we talking about here, it makes 

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
an economic difference to companies, that was one interesting 

32
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,117
feature. What does it do to help the company be successful? 

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,120
Protect revenue, increase revenue, manage your expenses, 

34
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:09,124
increase the visibility the brand, making the product standout 

35
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,129
from the competition and generally, finding more customers. 

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,133
Here's an example, the talks on this web page, talks about 

37
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,137
deciding whether the thing has business value or what, but we 

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,140
found this thing ... trick, the five Why's is to find relevance 

39
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,146
is works pretty well and basically, this is a very easy thing to 

40
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:34,149
implement. it's like your three- year- old nephew can implement 

41
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,154
this for you so let’ s start off with that box office manager. 

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,158
It’ s a box office manager so they induce patron to buy a 

43
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,161
ticket. I want to show her Facebook friends. Why? Okay, that’ s 

44
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:52,165
the first Why. I think more people will go and enjoy the show 

45
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,172
more if we do this so why is that important. Okay, I think we’ 

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,176
ll sold more tickets. Why is it important to sell more tickets? 

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,180
Because the theater makes more money. Why is it important to [ 

48
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,183
Frantino 00:03:03] make money and we want to make more money so 

49
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,186
we don’ t go out of business. Why is it matter if we go out of 

50
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,188
business? Then, you won’ t have a job, so it kind of surprising 

51
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,192
but this simple mechanism asking why a bunch of times kind of 

52
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,196
forces you to drop down in exactly what the issue is that you’ 

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,199
re talking about. Okay It’ s really helping us to the bottom 

54
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,204
line so, yes, it’ s a good one. If you ask a bunch of Why’ s and 

55
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,207
it stays vague then maybe this doesn’ t have a lot of relevance. 

56
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,211
The last part of SMART is Timeboxed. What we’ re worried about 

57
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,214
in software is, given the statistics, is that you’ re going to 

58
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,217
exceed the time budget. You’ re going to put something together 

59
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,219
and it takes a lot longer than you think so what we want to do 

60
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:49,223
is break it up in a smaller pieces so you avoid overestimating … 

61
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,229
not … Avoid underestimating. I guess on it, yeah, you’ re 

62
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,232
avoiding underestimating the length of the project that can take 

63
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,234
longer than you want. As we said, Tracker helps you with 

64
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,238
calculating net velocity.
