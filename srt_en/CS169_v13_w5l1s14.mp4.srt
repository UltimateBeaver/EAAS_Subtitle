1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're back. Rotten Potatoes again, but this time we're going to 

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,003
do some stuff. We're going to add this new feature using the 

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:11,006
TMDb and we're going to do routes and just everything that 

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:29,011
you're going to do at a small scale. Let's go back here. Because 

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:34,029
this is a new feature, we're going to create this feature in its 

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,034
own file in the features directory. Let's see what it looks 

7
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,037
like. I showed it on the screen there. Here it is, the feature 

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,041
and here's the little extra format as movie fan and this is 

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,045
doing the sad path were we have to do all the setup and then at 

10
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,049
the end, we said, we should see " movies does not exist here". 

11
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:59,052
That's the feature. Let's just go to Cucumber. I'll clear it 

12
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,059
again. We're going to want to do Cucumber, not for add movie 

13
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:12,064
feature but for search TMDb. Let's try it. This shouldn't work, 

14
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,072
but let's see how far it gets in this feature for searching 

15
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:23,075
TMDb. It said " The scenario failed." There are six steps in 

16
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:31,083
this case. One pass, one failed and the rest were skipped. Given 

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,091
I'm on the Rotten Potatoes homepage, you can have that, then I 

18
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:41,094
should see search TMDb and it said, " It failed" here. What we 

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:46,101
said earlier what was missing ... We said earlier what was 

20
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:59,106
missing; we want to add this Haml code to create the view. We 

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
don't have the view, so let's create the view. We're going to 

22
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:09,121
copy it. We're going to copy this code. The commercial slips 

23
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:18,129
right in there. I keep forgetting to do that. We've copied that, 

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,138
now let's go back to the terminal window and it says, " Add this 

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:31,142
to this Haml file under views." Use the Haml file under views 

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,151
and it actually said to add it to the end of this, so we'll add 

27
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:41,154
it to the end of that and let's write that out. Now, go back. 

28
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:58,161
Try Cuke again. Let's try it again. I tried putting Jeopardy 

29
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:09,178
music in but I'm afraid we get sued. What happened? A lot of 

30
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,189
message. That must have really made a bad turn here. Speaker 2: 

31
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:22,194
You probably did the indentation syntax error on the Haml. 

32
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:26,202
Speaker 1: No. There's no route. It looks bad but it's not a 

33
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,206
disaster. There's no route, so I just added the route. That's a 

34
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,209
lot of error messages for a route. Speaker 2: That's that pass 

35
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,212
before. Speaker 1: What? Speaker 2: That's that pass. Speaker 1: 

36
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:42,216
Let me show you what happens when I add the route. Yes, it did 

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,222
pass before when I add the route. Here's the route I'd have to 

38
00:03:46,226 --> 00:04:00,226
add. Let me just copy it in. Copy it. Let me go over here and we 

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,240
need to add the route. It actually says to put it right here 

40
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,245
after resources movies, it says that in the comments in the 

41
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:16,248
code. It says to do that there. Now, I have added the route and 

42
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:30,256
let's see what Cuke does with this. It's always exciting when 

43
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:38,270
you're giving a live demo. Look, three passed. Let's go back. 

44
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:43,278
Given I'm on the Rotten Potatoes homepage and I searched TMDb. 

45
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,283
When I fill the search terms and I press, it says, " Search 

46
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,286
TMDb." What it says is, and this is a much more comforting error 

47
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,289
message, I can't find the action, the method in the controller 

48
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,294
that you're supposed to invoke. That's because we haven't 

49
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:04,295
rendered it yet. That seems good. Let's go back to Pastebin, 

50
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,304
find that fake controller methods that often does is writes to 

51
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,308
the flash. It's never going to find a movie. It's a terrible 

52
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:18,311
search method. It always fails. We copy it, go back to the 

53
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,318
controller. We're going to add this to the controller. You can 

54
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:27,321
save it. You can add it anywhere, so let's just add it at the 

55
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:33,327
top. We've seen it, it looks like. Now, we've got the view, 

56
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,333
we've got the route, we've got the action. The route is supposed 

57
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:44,336
to be mapped too. Let's go back to Cuke and try it ... Okay, do 

58
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:57,344
it again. The suspense. Yes, everything passed. All six passed 

59
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,357
and everything is green. It's kind of visually exciting when you 

60
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,361
do the Cucumber and it works. When you do it and I did actually 

61
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:10,365
do it ... You didn't hear Armando said. Because Haml is not 

62
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,370
parenthesized, it's based on indentation, I did enter it one 

63
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,374
time with VI and it put extra spaces in and whole thing broke 

64
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,377
in. It's very disconcerting but it was exciting when it happens. 

65
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:29,381
Let's go back to PowerPoint here. How will we do the happy path 

66
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:35,389
part of that? We would repeat a whole lot of steps but the path 

67
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,395
is lovely and they also go off, but there's a whole lot of 

68
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,396
steps, the same between the happy path and the sad path. That 

69
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,399
doesn't seem very dry or repeating ourselves. So what do you do? 

70
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,402
What is a background thing in Cucumber that says, " You'd run 

71
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,406
this before you run any of the scenarios." It's a bunch of stuff 

72
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,409
that's common. You can just do it once. If we see this, this is 

73
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,415
the sad path; it's shorter than it used to be because we put the 

74
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,418
pieces of the sad path over here. But now, the happy path can 

75
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,422
use it too. Before any of these scenarios are run, no matter 

76
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,425
which one is running, it does all the background work and then 

77
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,428
you can just do the pieces of it and we'll do the happy path 

78
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,432
after we define the real method. Summarizing Cucumber, it's this 

79
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,436
amazing thing. I just can't believe it. When we go around and 

80
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,439
give talks about this, I was just at the University of 

81
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Washington last week, I think of it as a magic trick. I showed 

82
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,444
them the three by five cards and turns into an acceptance test. 

83
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,447
It brings all these together that you know, the color step 

84
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,451
green. Like I said, usually, you do the happy pass first and we 

85
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,455
do this intermittently with BDD and TDD as you'll see. It let's 

86
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,458
us dry out these scenarios with the background.
