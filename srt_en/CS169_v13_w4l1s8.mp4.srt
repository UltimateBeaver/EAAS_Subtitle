1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, let’ s try another cards again, so which of these stories 

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:10,005
is … Which of these features is least smart? User can search for 

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,010
a movie by title. Rotten Potatoes should have good response 

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,013
time. When adding a movie, 99% of the Add Movie pages should 

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,017
appear within three seconds, and as a customer, I want to see 

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,020
the top ten movies sold, listed by price, so that I can buy the 

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,023
cheapest ones first. We’ re trying for SMART User Stories, which 

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:32,027
one of these is dumbest, I guess? Okay. Ready, set, vote. Let’ s 

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:38,032
see what we got. A lot of you aren’ t voting. All right. I think 

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:44,038
that’ s kind of overwhelmingly green. Which of these letter they 

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,044
violating here? Search for a movie by title, that’ s not very … 

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:56,048
That’ s okay. The worst one is Rotten Potatoes good response 

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,056
time. It has the word “ good” in there so that’ s, you know, 

14
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,058
good is in the eye of the beholder. Certainly, three and four 

15
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,061
are pretty specific, right. 99% of the movies in less than three 

16
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,065
seconds, that’ s very specific and measurable and again, if the 

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,069
customer, it lays out who the stakeholders are. Top ten specific 

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:18,073
and measurable as well. Hopefully all of these are achievable 

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:23,078
and you Timeboxed them and can you figure out their business 

20
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,083
value by asking to Five Why’ s you can do that. User search for 

21
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:32,087
a movie title is a little vague but it’ s not as vague as the 

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,092
Rotten Potatoes having a good response time. Okay.
