1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, false about Lo- Fi UI. Like 3x5 cards, sketches and 

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:10,005
storyboards are more likely to involve all stakeholders versus 

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,010
just coding it. The purpose of Lo- Fi UI is to debug the UI 

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,014
before you program it. SaaS apps usually have user interfaces 

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,018
associated with user stories. While it takes more time than 

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,021
building a prototype in CSS Haml, the Lo- Fi UI are more likely 

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,024
to lead a UI that customers like. This is a really hard one 

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,027
here, okay? If you were listening. If you weren't on your 

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:42,030
phones. Okay, ready, set, vote. Wow, okay. This is false, right? 

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,042
Which one's false? You should talk about this. Which one of 

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:53,045
these is false about Lo- Fi UI. All right, let's vote as pairs. 

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,053
Ready, set, vote to see how this turns out. Okay, well that 

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,056
actually worked, it largely converged to blue here. Let's go 

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,059
over the answers. Instead of code, 3x5 cards and sketches and 

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,064
storyboards are more likely to involve everyone. That's 

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,067
important because you want to make ... that'll help us make it 

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,071
something that the people, that the customer wants at the end. 

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,075
We want to debug it before we program it by throwing away sheets 

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,078
of paper or scratching up sheets of paper. That's going to be a 

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
lot less work. SaaS apps usually have user interfaces, stories 

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:30,084
and then ... maybe you guys can whip something up little pretty 

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,090
quickly, but probably we think it'll take you less time than 

23
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:39,093
doing it in Haml. So the false answer was number four.
